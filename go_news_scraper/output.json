[{"Topic":"War in Ukraine","Title":"Tanzanian killed in Ukraine: We told him not to go","Article":"Nemes Tarimo's family in Tanzania warned him against agreeing to fight with Russian forces in Ukraine, but the 33-year-old had a big incentive to sign up.It is now three weeks since his relatives learnt of the news that confirmed their worst fears. He had died in combat.Everyone at the family home in the city of Dar es Salaam looks exhausted as they wait for news about when his body might come back.The waiting is taking its toll.There are about 15 people in the compound, and relatives are coming in and out all day wanting to hear if there are any updates.One says they last heard from him in October when he had said he had agreed to sign up with the Russian mercenary group Wagner.\"Nemes informed me and some other family members about joining Wagner, and we advised him not to,\" the family member, who did not want to give their name, tells the BBC.But for the young man, who relatives describe as polite, God-fearing and supportive, there was an offer that was hard to resist.The family says that Tarimo, who had ambitions to be an MP with the opposition Chadema party, had been in Moscow as an ICT master's student at the Russian Technological University. But he was then imprisoned some time after January 2021 for what were described as drugs-related offences.Last year, he was enticed with a deal: sign up and be pardoned or stay in prison.\"He said he would join to free himself,\" the relative says.This case echoes that of 23-year-old Zambian student Lemekhani Nyirenda, who had also been in prison in Russia and died last year fighting with Wagner.Zambian Foreign Minister Stanley Kakubo told parliament that he had been informed about how prisoners could be pardoned if they agreed to fight.Last September, Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin was seen in leaked footage outlining the rules of fighting, such as no deserting or sexual contact with Ukrainian women, and then giving the prisoners five minutes to decide if they want to sign up.Tarimo's family has learnt that he died at the end of October while on a combat mission in Ukraine with Wagner. \"We last communicated with him on 17 October, when he was already a member of Wagner.\"We then got information in December from his friends over his death,\" which according to media reports, was a result of Ukrainian artillery fire.The Federal News Agency, a Russian broadcaster used by Mr Prigozhin to boost his group's reputation, has published a video of what it said was Tarimo's memorial service in a chapel in the town of Goryachiy Klyuch. It reported that he had died on 24 October near Bakhmut, the scene of intense fighting in recent months. Russia's state-owned domestic news agency, Ria Novosti, interviewed someone who said he had fought alongside Tarimo. He said the Tanzanian had died while trying to help a wounded soldier.The Federal News Agency says that Tarimo was awarded a posthumous medal \"for courage\" by the Wagner Group.Relatives have been in touch with the embassy in Moscow, but the Tanzanian government, which has remained neutral on the conflict in Ukraine, has yet to publicly comment on the student's death.The family want to bury Tarimo in their village in the Southern Highlands region, but until his remains are returned they cannot make any plans.\"We don't want to believe that he is gone until we receive the body… we are really sad because we have lost a well-respected young man in this area.\"","Date":"2023-01-20 15:26:00.000Z","Url":"/news/world-africa-64338677","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D8F0/production/_128363555_tarimo3.jpg"},{"Topic":"War in Ukraine","Title":"Give us tanks, says Zelensky, as Western allies meet","Article":"Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky has made a direct appeal for tanks at crunch talks involving dozens of Western allies in southern Germany.The US and European nations have already promised more weapons. But Mr Zelensky told defence ministers at Ramstein airbase: \"Hundreds of thank yous are not hundreds of tanks.\"Germany in particular is under growing pressure to send its Leopard 2 tanks and to allow other countries to provide Ukraine with their own Leopards.Under German law, the government in Berlin would have to give its permission before countries such as Poland or Finland could commit to re-exporting them.Germany's new defence minister, Boris Pistorius, told reporters at Ramstein: \"'None of us can say today when there will be a decision for Leopard tanks and what the decision may look like.\"Defence colleagues from more than 50 countries gathered at the airbase on Friday, a day after several nations pledged more equipment to help Ukraine fend off further Russia campaigns. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told them it was time to \"dig deeper\".Almost 11 months into Russia's war in Ukraine, Nato military figures believe Moscow is planning a renewed spring offensive with troop numbers bolstered by a partial mobilisation since the end of September.Western officials see a potential \"window of opportunity\" in the coming weeks for Ukraine to push Russian forces back. They say Moscow is running short of ammunition and trained troops - despite efforts to replenish stocks and mobilise additional forces. For its part, Russia has warned of increasing Nato involvement, direct as well as indirect, in the conflict. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that sending tanks would not change the course of the conflict, but would \"create more problems for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people\".The UK has already announced it will send 14 Challenger 2 battle tanks. But Kyiv wants more tanks and UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he hoped that the 50 allies would \"all hear the message that unlocking the tank is part of 2023\".Germany's Leopard tanks are key to that equation. They are in more plentiful supply than the British tank, and are operated by more than a dozen other nations. Ahead of the Ramstein meeting Mr Zelensky criticised Germany's hesitant attitude to sending tanks, assuring Berlin that the Leopards would only be used in self-defence and not go through Russia. \"If you have Leopard [tanks], then give them to us,\" he told German public TV.Polish deputy foreign minister Pawel Jablonski indicated on Friday that Warsaw might be prepared to provide Ukraine with Leopards regardless of Berlin's views. \"We'll see. I think if there is strong resistance, we'll be ready to take even such non-standard action. But let's not anticipate the facts,\" he told Polish radio. Berlin was reported this week to have made a decision on the Leopard conditional on the US agreeing to send Abrams tanks, which it is not intending to do. The defence minister denied Germany was blocking deliveries of the tank unilaterally and said that when a decision was made he wanted to be able to move fast.\"That's why this morning I told my ministry to make an inventory of the different types of Leopard tanks we have within our military but also within the industry.\"There are fears of escalation in Berlin and of going it alone. Until recently, Germany refused requests to send a Patriot air defence battery, but it relented as soon as the US did the same. On tanks too, Berlin would like to see the US take the lead. Ben Wallace has rejected talk of escalation. Germany along with the US and UK, he argued, had already supplied artillery systems, like Himars, with a much longer range. Mr Zelensky has repeatedly taken aim at Berlin's perceived hesitancy and on Thursday criticised suggestions that the US and Germany were only planning to commit vehicles if the other nation did the same. Retired US Army general David Petraeus said there was \"legitimate reluctance\" in Washington on the issue of sending Abrams tanks because they were difficult to maintain and had a jet turbine.He told the BBC it was \"imperative\" that any Western tank donations were made \"early enough, so [Ukrainian soldiers] can actually train on them\".On Thursday, Western nations pledged to send more vehicles, artillery and munitions to bolster the Ukrainian war effort.The US committed a new package worth $2.5bn (£2bn), saying this took its spend on Ukrainian support to $26.7bn since last February's full-scale invasion by Russia.Tanks were not included in the offer, but the Pentagon did promise an extra 59 Bradley armoured vehicles, 90 Stryker personnel carriers and Avenger air defence systems, among other provisions.The announcement came after nine European nations promised more support of their own following a meeting in Estonia. This included:","Date":"2023-01-20 14:23:00.000Z","Url":"/news/world-europe-64341337","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/900B/production/_128357863_f4a7463243afa0372002e8f7e63fb1ef0a4135270_525_4752_26731000x563.jpg"},{"Topic":"War in Ukraine","Title":"What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?","Article":"Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Kyiv has been provided with a huge range of military equipment by more than 30 countries.The US announced fresh support worth $2.5bn (£2bn) this week, including armoured vehicles, but not main battle tanks which have been requested by Kyiv.The UK has said it will send Challenger 2 tanks to help Ukraine's war effort, and Berlin is facing calls to allow German-made Leopard 2 tanks to be sent.Ukraine's requirements have changed significantly as the war has progressed.Ukraine's President Volodomyr Zelensky says his forces need Western main battle tanks urgently, to defend territory from Russian attack, and to push Russian troops out of occupied areas.Some Western officials similarly believe that Russian forces are currently in a weak position, and that there is a window of opportunity in which more advanced tanks may help Ukraine to push forward.The UK has agreed to provide 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine.Challenger 2 is the British army's main battle tank. Challenger 2 was built in the 1990s, but is significantly more advanced than other tanks available to Ukraine's armed forces.Ukraine used Warsaw Pact designed T-72 tanks prior to the invasion, and since February 2022 has received more than 200 T-72s from Poland, the Czech Republic and a small number of other countries.In the months which followed the Russian invasion, Western nations were keen to offer Ukraine Warsaw Pact rather than Nato standard weaponry, because Ukraine's armed forces had a ready supply of trained crew, spare parts and maintenance capabilities.Switching to Nato standard tanks requires a range of logistical support which Ukraine did not have in place.Now, Ukraine wants German Leopard 2 tanks, used by a number of European countries.Germany has been under intense international pressure to donate Leopard 2s, but has not done so and crucially has not given its permission for other countries with Leopard 2s to pass them to Ukraine.The Leopard 2 is easier to maintain and requires less fuel than some western alternatives.Reports suggest that Germany will change its position on Leopard 2s unless the US sends its own Abrams main battle tanks.The US is bar far the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine overall.US officials say they are not ready to do this. \"The Abrams tank is a very complicated piece of equipment. It's expensive. It's hard to train on. It has a jet engine,\" according to the Pentagon's top security adviser, Colin Kahl.Military professionals point out that success on the battlefield requires a vast range of equipment, deployed in coordination, with the necessary logistical support in place.Among the many vehicles donated to Ukraine is the Stryker armoured fighting vehicle.On Thursday, the US announced it was sending 90 Strykers.Among the other vehicles donated by the US this week are 59 more Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. They were used extensively by US forces in Iraq.On 21 December, the US announced it was sending the Patriot missile system to Ukraine. This highly sophisticated system has a range of up to 62 miles (100km), depending on the type of missile used, and requires specialised training for Ukrainian soldiers, likely to be carried out at a US Army base in Germany. But the system is expensive to operate - one Patriot missile costs around $3m.Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine has been using Soviet-era S-300 surface-to-air systems against Russian attacks.Before the conflict began in February, Ukraine had about 250 S-300s and there have been efforts to replenish these with similar systems stockpiled in other former Soviet countries, with some coming from Slovakia.The US has also provided Nasams (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) to Ukraine. The first Nasams arrived in Ukraine in November.In addition, the UK has provided several air defence systems, including Starstreak, designed to bring down low-flying aircraft at short range.Germany has also provided air defence systems, including the IRIS-T air defence systems which can hit approaching missiles at an altitude of up to 20km.Among the long-range rocket launchers sent to Ukraine by the US are the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or Himars. Several European countries have also sent similar systems. Himars are believed to have been central to Ukraine's success in pushing Russian forces back in the south, particularly in Kherson in November.Crucially, the range of Himars, and many other systems, varies according to the munitions used, and it is believed that western donors have not provided the ammunition with the longest range.The munitions thought to have been supplied to Ukraine give the system a range of about 50 miles (80km), which is further than the Smerch system on the Russian side.Himars systems are also much more accurate than the equivalent Russian systems. In the months following the invasion and Russia's retreat from Kyiv, much of the war centred on the east of the country where supplies of artillery to Ukraine were in  heavy demand.Australia, Canada and the US were among the countries to send advanced M777 howitzers and ammunition to Ukraine.The range of the M777 is similar to Russia's Giatsint-B howitzer, and much longer than Russia's  D-30 towed gun.Thousands of Nlaw weapons, designed to destroy tanks with a single shot, have also been supplied to Ukraine.The weapons are thought to have been particularly important in stopping the advance of Russian forces on Kyiv in the hours and days following the invasion.\"Nlaw was absolutely critical to the defeat of Russian ground thrusts in the early stages of the war,\" according to Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute.Drones have featured heavily in the conflict so far, with many used for surveillance, targeting and heavy lift operations.Turkey has sold Bayraktar TB2 armed drones to Ukraine in recent months, whilst the Turkish manufacturer of the system has donated drones to crowd-funding operations in support of Ukraine.Analysts say the Bayraktar TB2s have been extremely effective, flying at about 25,000 feet (7,600m) before descending to attack Russian targets with laser-guided bombs.They are believed to have destroyed helicopters, naval vessels and missile systems.They have also been used to provide the exact locations of Russian positions for precision artillery strikes.Additional reporting by Tom Spencer.

Tom Hashemi will be embarking on the 2,000km journey in the hope of raising £20,000 for the Mines Advisory Group (MAG), which works to clear landmines worldwide.The cycle ride is expected to last for two weeks and Mr Hashemi is calling for other cyclists to join him.He sets off in late April.Mr Hashemi was inspired to organise the ride when he heard about how children are particularly prone to mine casualties when they are out playing in fields or woodland.He explained that \"kids being kids\", they often ignore their parents' warnings, and this made him think of his five-year-old son.\"I thought, 'I can imagine my son doing that',\" Mr Hashemi said.He was also motivated to do the cycle ride as he has colleagues in Ukraine, who have been affected by \"power cuts, curfews and Russian missiles\".It costs about £500 on average for one landmine to be cleared - he hopes to raise enough to clear 40 or more.To do this, he will travel an average distance of 140km a day and go through seven countries in total, including France, Belgium and Poland. Mr Hashemi, the CEO of communications agency Cast from Clay, hopes his fundraiser will encourage people to \"think long term\" about how to support Ukraine as the one-year anniversary of the invasion approaches.\"It's not just about sending weapons or taking in refugees,\" he said. \"I want to raise awareness of the challenges faced by Ukraine not just now, but years into the future.\"He emphasised that landmines in the country would remain there \"decades after the conflict ends\".According to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine (SES), about 30% of Ukraine's land could be mined as a result of the conflict.In 2019, Ukraine was marked third in the world for mine casualties, due to the 2014 conflict there.The UN Children's Fund estimated at the time that some 400,000 children in eastern Ukraine were at risk from mines on a daily basis.Darren Cormack, the CEO of MAG, said the conflict had left a \"devastating and deadly legacy\" in both rural and populated areas of Ukraine.He explained that the charity had been \"working closely with local partners to provide risk education to at-risk groups\" and intended to \"scale up and accelerate our efforts to keep people safe\".\"We stand with the people of Ukraine, as we stand with all communities afflicted by conflict.\"Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The US says a package worth $2.5bn (£2bn) will be sent, including armoured vehicles and air defence systems.Several European nations promised their own new packages - including hundreds of missiles pledged to Kyiv by the UK.The announcements come ahead of a crunch meeting scheduled in Germany on Friday, in which 50 countries are set to co-ordinate arms supplies.A meeting on Thursday saw representatives from 11 nations gather at an army base in Estonia to discuss a range of new packages to help Ukraine recapture territory and fend off any further Russian advances.Nine countries - the UK, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Denmark, Czech Republic, Estonia, the Netherlands and Slovakia - promised more support.The packages announced in a joint statement include:The Netherlands will announce its package of support on Friday.Speaking during his visit to Estonia, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: \"In 2023, it is time to turn the momentum that the Ukrainians have achieved in pushing back Russia into gains and... push them back out of Ukraine and to restore Ukraine's sovereignty, which is their right under international law.\"The announcement of fresh US support arrived later on Thursday. Despite Ukrainian hopes, it did not contain an offer of tanks.But the Pentagon did promise Kyiv an extra 59 Bradley armoured vehicles, 90 Stryker personnel carriers and Avenger air defence systems, among other large and small munitions. It said recent air attacks demonstrated \"the devastating impact of Russia's brutal war in Ukraine\" - but said the newly-pledged arms would help to fend these off.A statement added that the US had now committed more than $26.7bn in security assistance to Ukraine since Moscow's full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022.A meeting of the Ukraine Defence Group, made up of key allies including the US, will convene at Ramstein air base in Germany on Friday to discuss further military support. President Zelensky said he expected \"strong decisions\" on further arms exports to be made at that meeting, including a \"powerful military support package\" from the US. The talks are likely to focus on the question of whether to send heavy tanks, and crucially who will supply them. Despite the billions of dollars pledged in new weapons by Western allies on Thursday, this question remains unanswered.Ukraine is asking for German-made Leopard tanks to be sent to the front line. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is coming under increasing international and domestic pressure to supply them, or at least approve their delivery by third countries. Poland and Finland have both promised to send their Leopards - but need Germany's permission, as the manufacturing country, to do so. Poland's Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said he was \"moderately pessimistic\" about Germany giving permission to re-export Leopards to Ukraine.And President Zelensky has also addressed Germany's reluctance. \"Now we are waiting for a decision from one European capital that will activate the prepared chains of co-operation on tanks,\" he said on Thursday evening.A government source in Berlin told Reuters it is yet to receive a request from any country to re-export their tanks.The UK was the first nation to offer tanks to Ukraine when it promised to send 14 British army Challenger 2s.","Date":"2023-01-20 00:36:00.000Z","Url":"/news/world-europe-64335666","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1684B/production/_128353229_ukrainecaesar.png"},{"Topic":"Coronavirus","Title":"Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?","Article":"What can statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales?Here we update some of the key weekly and monthly data for measuring the pandemic and also assess some of the key Covid-19 indicators over the past two years.We are now at a \"Covid stable\" stage of the pandemic, but a watch is still being kept on infection estimates and the numbers of people being admitted to hospital and deaths during the winter period.One in 25 people - 121,600 or 3.94% of the population - were estimated to have had Covid in the most recent week, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), compared to 157,000 the week before.There have been falls now for the last two weeks following a sharp rise in December.ONS estimates that there are 12,600 new Covid infections a day in Wales.Since summer 2020, the ONS has organised a weekly nose and throat swab survey involving thousands of households across Wales, which now sees people being sent test kits by post.It has become the most important tool to measure the level of infections, with the end of mass testing at the end of March 2022.Infections are estimated to be falling in other UK nations too.The estimates are that one in 40 people in England, one in 30 in Scotland and one in 25 in Northern Ireland have the virus.Wales is estimated to have a higher proportion of people with Covid than other UK nations and regions, apart from Northern Ireland.The number of hospital patients testing positive for Covid by 17 January was 40% of the levels we saw at the same time the year before.Numbers are falling and peaked in late December, while few patients testing positive are being \"actively\" treated for Covid.We know about 91% of people are currently being treated primarily for other conditions and happen to test positive while in hospital or on admission. The number of patients testing positive for Covid in hospital beds in Wales averaged 332 a day in the week to 17 January - down 35% on the week before.Of these, there were an average of 286 in acute beds, compared with 444 the week before.The vast majority continue to be \"incidental\" Covid patients, who happen to test positive in hospital.Only 21 (8%) of confirmed Covid patients in acute beds on 17 January were being primarily treated for the virus, with 229 patients in hospital being treated for other conditions.When we include patients with suspected Covid and those recovering, there were 786 people on average in hospital beds over the past week - 15% down on the week before. With other patients with other winter respiratory conditions, like flu and RSV, they make up 12% of hospital in-patients.There were an average of 346 patients recovering in the week ending 17 January, so they were no longer testing positive for Covid but were waiting for discharge or for a care package to become available.This can add to pressures on hospitals.Numbers in critical care with Covid are averaging 14 a day, slightly down on the week before.There are 16 times more non-Covid patients in critical care than patients with the virus.   Last April, there were 27 Covid patients in critical care, while in the second wave in 2020-21 it peaked at 150 patients.The mortality rate of critical care Covid patients, in the most recent study of 286 Welsh patients since January 2022, was about 32.9%, including those who died later on a general ward.About 69% had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived are spending less time in critical care than earlier in the pandemic. The average age of those admitted so far in 2022 is 58, just over half are men and they are likely to be overweight. More than half are from more deprived parts of Wales. About 29% were under 50.The study, at a UK level, showed 61% of those Covid patients in critical care were unvaccinated in December 2021.Numbers of admissions of people testing positive for Covid are averaging nine a day - the winter peak so far was 20 over Christmas.Covid-positive patients now only make up 0.9% of all admissions.About 9% of patients in acute hospital beds with Covid were being primarily or \"actively\" treated for the virus on average in the past week. The average number has been 25 in the most recent week, down from 40 the week before.It does not mean these patients cannot have complications because of Covid and it can still present challenges for patient management.Broken down by health board, Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Cardiff and Vale recorded notable numbers of patients testing positive who were being treated \"actively\" for Covid in the past week.There has been a higher proportion of patients with Covid being treated primarily for the virus in critical care - and that was seven out of nine acute patients on 17 January.The Icnarc intensive care study has found a far smaller proportion of critical care patients with Covid were being primarily treated for the virus after January 2022 (27%), compared to the period before (nearly 86%).The figures on \"incidental\" Covid cases have only been published in recent months.Digital Health and Care Wales indicated the data had no standard definition for \"actively being treated for Covid\", meaning there were some differences between health boards in how they arrived at the figure so we have to take a little care in how these are interpreted.Patients who are asymptomatic are no longer being tested routinely so this is another factor to consider.There were 159 positive tests for Covid in hospitals in the week ending 17 January, down from the Christmas period.Public Health Wales figures show in the latest week, \"probably\" or \"definitely\" hospital-acquired cases in patients are about the same as those community-acquired or indeterminate Covid cases. Hospital-acquired infections stood at 80.There have been more than 17,820 hospital-acquired infections recorded since the start of the pandemic.An indication of pressure on the NHS is overall bed occupancy in acute hospitals, which hit a high of 95% in the week ending 26 October.It remains close to the record, reaching 94.6% in the most recent seven days.We know that recent modelling from Welsh government scientists suggested in a \"worst case\" scenario that Covid, flu and other respiratory conditions could account for 2,750 hospital beds - or 28% of total capacity at the winter peak in 2022-23.The \"most likely\" scenario had been for 1,390 patients with Covid, flu and other respiratory conditions on 9 December, including 668 with confirmed positive tests for Covid.By 15 January it appeared to be passed its peak, with 1,224 patients with Covid, flu or RSV - or 14% of all in-patients in hospital beds.About 70% of flu patients had picked up the virus while in hospital for something else.There were 27 patients with flu in critical care.The age profile for flu patients saw 85% over the age of 60.Modelling for Covid alone peaked at more than 1,800 patients with the virus in a \"worst case scenario\" in December.But the actual curve for patients with Covid positive tests - which had fallen even below the \"most likely\" scenario and was closer to the \"optimistic\" scenario - by early January had moved again above the scenarios.Scientific advisers with a more up to date projection at the end of November suggested hospital bed occupancy with Covid would continue to decline to December and reach a plateau in the following weeks. A slight increase in Covid admissions was projected towards the end of January and February.Another measure of pressure on the health service is NHS staff absence.A total of 0.9% of staff - about 962 - were absent due to Covid-related sickness in the week to 3 January. Another 0.2% of staff were having to self-isolate, according to the bi-monthly Welsh government figures. This does not include NHS Wales staff absent for other reasons. Total absence stands at 6.9%, higher than the usual pre-pandemic figure of about 5%.The quarterly average to June was 6.6%, down from 7.2% in the three months to March, which was the second highest rate on record.The latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics suggests 97.1% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection.The estimate is 95.7% of 16 to 24-year-olds in Wales would have tested positive for antibodies.At the higher threshold, 79.7% of adults in Wales are at or above 800 nanograms per millilitre and nearly three quarters in those aged 16 to 24 and 95.3% of the 75-79 age group.As part of its weekly swab survey, involving many thousands of people across the UK, some participants also have their level of antibodies checked in a blood test and are also asked a series of other questions towards fact-finding about Covid.Scientific advisers to the Welsh government said 0.6% of people aged 12 and over were estimated to be at risk of going to hospital with Covid at the start of April 2022, compared with 9.3% two years before, at the start of the pandemic.And for those at-risk groups, 6% were estimated to be at risk of needing hospital treatment and 7% of the over 60s.This is thanks to vaccination and natural protection from immunity after having infection.The rate at which GPs are consulted about Covid-19 is also another indicator, which peaked in the first week of January 2022 at 98 consultations per 100,000 and has now fallen back to around three per 100,000. The number of people who have died when Covid was a contributory factor has reached 11,304 in Wales, for registrations so far.In the most recent week, up to 6 January, 57 people in Wales had a death registered which involved Covid-19 and saw it included as a contributory factor on their death certificate, according to the ONS.There were no Covid deaths in only three local authorities: Denbighshire, Flintshire and Gwynedd.When counted by day occurring - not day registered - there were 33 deaths involving Covid in the past week registered so far, compared to 56 in the previous week.However, the most recent weekly figures are usually an underestimate, due to delays in registrations catching up.Up to 6 January, a total of 11,265 deaths involving Covid have occurred during the pandemic in Wales.ONS says that up to the end of November, of deaths registered so far, there have been 9,282 deaths due to Covid, with the virus the underlying cause of death.Deaths involving Covid are running lower than at the same point in 2021, with the total number of deaths involving Covid 46% of what we saw up to 2 December in 2021.There were 27 deaths between 18-19 July 2022, the most since January. This was at the height of the summer heatwave.The Omicron wave from December 2021 brought a peak in deaths of 20 on 15 January 2022, the same level as the peaks in deaths in September and October.The ONS measure includes deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes.During 2021, there were 4,055 deaths involving Covid.That included 209 deaths in December 2021. In December 2020, there were 1,333 deaths involving Covid.The second wave in the winter brought 83 deaths on 11 January 2021 alone - the worst single day during the pandemic in Wales.ONS also records so-called \"excess deaths\". This has been seen as a useful measure of the pandemic's impact because it looks at deaths from all causes overall, compared with the five-year, non-pandemic average.So since March 2020, there have been 8,850 more deaths than we might expect to see on average.That includes nearly 1,852 excess deaths in 2022 so far.There have been 1,704 deaths from all causes above the non-pandemic average since July alone, with 867 of them not involving Covid.Deaths have been above the five-year pre-pandemic norm for all but two of the last 30 weeks.There were 979 deaths from all causes - this is 135 more (16%) than the average in the most recent week. Covid accounted for 5.8% of all deaths in Wales in the latest week, more than the proportion in England (4.9%).Across England and Wales, with 72% of deaths with Covid mentioned on the death certificate, it was also the underlying cause of death in the latest week.Nearly a fifth (18%) of all Covid deaths registered have occurred in care homes.There were four deaths involving Covid involving a care home resident registered in the latest week - out of 207 deaths overall.Care Inspectorate Wales reports that deaths peaked in May 2020 and said it has been notified of 2,271 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid since the pandemic began.It had been notified of four deaths involving Covid during November.ONS analysis of deaths in care homes in 2021 found mortality rates lower in Wales in men than in England or any English region.Covid was the second highest cause of death in care home residents after dementia, accounting for 12.9% of male resident deaths and 11.1% of female resident deaths.Covid-19 was the eighth leading cause of death in Wales in December, after being the ninth leading cause in November.Mortality analysis by the ONS showed deaths due to Covid - 92 in total occurred over the month - accounted for 2.7% of all registered deaths. Looking at when Covid was a contributory factor, there were 120 deaths involving Covid in Wales - or 3.9% of all deaths registered in November.Dementia was again the leading cause of death in December in Wales, for the fifth consecutive month - however heart disease ranked as the leading cause of death for the whole of 2022. Flu and pneumonia again ranked fourth, ahead of Covid, with its mortality rate for a fourth month in succession.Covid was the seventh leading cause of death in 2022, with a mortality rate of 38.5 deaths per 100,000, after being the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease in 2021 and the leading cause of death at the height of the pandemic in 2020.The ONS, which takes into account population and age structure, found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales in December was 30.1 deaths per 100,000 - an increase on November's figure. Across the course of the pandemic, the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is slightly higher in Wales (115.3 deaths per 100,000), than England on 114.7 deaths per 100,000, with Scotland (107) and Northern Ireland (106.4) both lower in the 34 months to the end of November.The age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England than in Wales.It is also higher in all English regions apart from south west, south east and east England.When a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales.The ONS also looks at how deaths are registered on certificates and found Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 72% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales in December. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic, 83.3% of deaths with Covid on death certificates can be said to be due to Covid since the pandemic began.So, there were 9,374 deaths due to Covid by the end of 2022 in Wales, 54% of them male.In about 4% of these deaths, the doctor had written that Covid was \"suspected\".A doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) has the highest mortality rate over the course of the pandemic in Wales.By 6 January, RCT had reached a total of 1,160 deaths and also had the eighth highest crude mortality rate (488 deaths per 100,000) of all local authorities across England and Wales.Merthyr Tydfil (481.3 deaths per 100,000) was the ninth highest and Bridgend 15th (464.6 deaths per 100,000).RCT has overtaken Cardiff (1,145) for the most deaths in Wales up to 30 December.Six of RCT's communities were also in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates can be broken down further.At a health board level, the age-standardised mortality rate for Cwm Taf Morgannwg, which covers RCT, Merthyr and Bridgend, was 149.7 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the pandemic up to the end of November 2022. This is the highest in Wales, the lowest being 62.4 deaths due to Covid in the Powys health board area, set against a Welsh average of 98.2.The community with the highest number of Covid deaths across 2020 and 2021, including in the first two waves of the pandemic, was Tonyrefail West, with a total of 63 deaths due to Covid.This was followed by Sandfields in Port Talbot and Porth East and Ynyshir in Rhondda Cynon Taf (55 deaths each), by the end of 2021.When translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Gwersyllt West and Summerhill in Wrexham was the highest at 742.6 deaths per 100,000 - or 44 deaths over the two years.This was followed by Tonyrefail West, Port Talbot East and Llanelli Bigyn in Carmarthenshire.All communities of Wales have now had at least two deaths during the pandemic.The lowest number of deaths at a community level were in Aberystwyth North and Aberystwyth South, Bangor City and Llandudno Junction South and Llansanffraid Glan Conwy.At a local authority level, in the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales.In 2021, Bridgend had the highest Covid mortality rate - 271 deaths or 183.2 deaths per 100,000; this was the 24th highest area across England and Wales.There are figures to compare relative excess deaths in different European countries.Bulgaria has the highest relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rate - 18.2% higher than normal - and Norway the lowest, 4.1% below average.Wales was 3.7% above average in June 2021 and then 2.1% above average in July 2022 - ranked 21st out of 33 nations.For those aged under 65, Wales was 4.8% above average (ranked 12th) and 1.5% above average (joint 24th) in the over-65s.  Wales also saw excess mortality in more than half of weeks over the period.More than 8.5m doses of vaccine have been administered in Wales since December 2020.The vast majority in recent weeks have been autumn boosters, although the programme is now down to a trickle.So far, more than 1.1m autumn boosters have been given out, reaching more than 88% of care home residents and 80% of over 65s. Nearly 58% of those aged 50 to 64 have also had autumn boosters.Wales has reached proportionately more of key groups with autumn boosters than England, although fewer than Scotland.There are also fewer of the key groups reached than the earlier phases of the programme.The boosters were reaching fewer elderly people from black and ethnic minorities, with the gap widest in the over 80s - just 40% compared to 54% of white over 80s by early October.The previous booster campaign saw 85% of those eligible being given a dose.Public Health Wales is now only reporting Covid vaccination figures weekly.The dominant variant in Wales was Omicron in 2022, and nearly 2,000 new cases have been sequenced in the last month.Because of the ending of mass testing in April 2022, we should not expect to see the same numbers of results going off for sequencing any more.So far, 29,265 cases of a sub-variant of Omicron, BA.2, have been recorded in Wales but very few cases in recent months.It overtook the \"original\" Omicron in all areas of Wales but this sub-variant itself has been overtaken by other sub-variants, especially BA.5.There have been 306 cases of the new sub-variant BQ.1 again in the last week - related to the BA.5 strain.Infection estimates by ONS suggest BA.5 overtook the BA.1 strain in early March 2022, while the following BA.4 and BA.5 strains overtook BA.2 in the second week of June in Wales.Health officials say the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants are six times more transmissible than the original Wuhan Covid strain but that vaccines were still working to prevent serious illness in most people.The numbers of people who are reporting they have long Covid symptoms in Wales a year after being infected are estimated to be at record levels. There are 63,000 people -  or 2% of the population - who are estimated to still be suffering symptoms 12 months or more since having Covid.A total of 111,000 people were estimated to have long Covid at any duration. Of these, 18% said it had \"a lot\" of impact on their daily lives.An estimated 3.6% of people in Wales report having long Covid - this is slightly more than in Scotland and Northern Ireland and higher than all regions of England except the North East.Just over 2% reported long Covid after a year - more than other UK nations and English regions apart from North East and North West.The estimates are based on a sample size of 14,000 people in Wales.Across the UK, prevalence was greatest in the 35 to 69 age group, in women, and in people living in deprived areas.A survey of more than 1,600 people with long Covid in Wales referred to the Adferiad recovery programme found around 70% were female and half were aged over 50.Of those needing follow-up, around a quarter had hospital treatment. Average stays were around two weeks.Fatigue, \"brain fog\" and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms.Scientific advisers for the Welsh government estimate that potentially up to a quarter of people who have Covid may develop long Covid.In January 2022, this would have included far higher proportions of Covid cases involving people aged between 50 and 70 - an estimated 43% of those with Covid.But even if 6% of young people under 25 with Covid developed long-term symptoms, this could still mean more than 2,200 young people with long Covid in Wales.This analysis was used to develop a \"social cost\" estimate for Covid, which looked at the cost to the NHS of treating Covid at different stages of the pandemic.With the effects of the vaccine, and less patient time in hospital and intensive care, it meant this estimated cost had fallen from £21,000 per case in the second wave of the pandemic to £5,769 per case by January 2022.Of this, more than £4,800 per case would be the cost of long Covid.When we look at infections in communities, broken down into middle-layer super output areas, with populations averaging 5,000, there has generally a split between rural and more urban areas.This is still noticeable when we look at a map of community case rates for the whole pandemic, taking into account population sizes.The Wales positivity rate was around 18% by the end of 2022 but there were far fewer PCR tests after the end of mass testing in April.At the peak of the Omicron wave at the end of 2021, the positivity rate reached 51.6%.Locally, Neath Port Talbot over the course of the whole pandemic had the highest positivity rate (18.8%) and Ceredigion the lowest.Earlier in the pandemic, a 5% positivity threshold was suggested by the World Health Organisation as an indicator that infections were too high.There was a much younger profile to cases in the third wave in the latter half of 2021.Between January and March there was a rise in proportions of those aged 20 to 40 testing positive. In terms of PCR tests, the 20 to 40 age group made up more than 41% of positive results this winter.In the most recent week, the 40 to 59 year age group still had the highest incidence for lateral flow test positives. All of Wales' 22 council areas saw falls in their under-25 case rates in the last week of figures, which included the period when mass testing ended. The 30 to 39 age group had the largest proportion of cases in the last, most reliable week for PCR tests.Over the winter months, the under-19 age group has made up 20% of cases, a rise on the year before.The so-called R-number - the reproduction number - had been a tool to express the infection rate of Covid.However, it is has now been phased out as a measure.Expressed within a range, if it was above 1, this indicated that infections were growing. The range for the last estimate in December 2022 was between 0.9 and 1.2, suggesting infections were rising. So, for every 10 people with Covid in Wales, between another nine and 12 people would be infected.More than 8.7 million Covid-19 tests have been carried out during the pandemic, with the first positive result recorded in Swansea on 27 February 2020.For most of the first wave, testing was confined to hospitals and some care homes but mass testing became available in the spring of 2020.This ended at the start of April 2022, although it will remain in place for hospital patients and there will be some for vulnerable people and those with symptoms in care homes.There are around 4,500 PCR tests currently taking place each week, compared to around 200,000 a week at the pandemic's peak.Testing that's processed privately - at so-called Lighthouse labs - is no longer taking place.Free lateral flow tests (LFTs) are no longer available, except to certain groups and in certain settings.From the summer of 2021, and with the easing of restrictions, they had been used more for asymptomatic people going to work or attending events.Then between April and July 2022, people with symptoms were asked to take LFTs.The number reporting tests had been falling as a result of the end of freely-available LFT kits.Lateral flow test results have not been reported since the end of November 2022.Up to the end of routine testing in April 2022, about 17,000 PCR tests routinely took place in hospitals each week and up to 30,000 weekly in care homes. There have also now been changes to guidance for Covid testing in hospitals, although patients will still be tested before admission or ahead of surgery or chemotherapy.Since the end of mass testing, only about 4,000-5,000 PCR tests are being carried out each week.Altogether, around 32,500 positive results were recorded in care homes over the course of the routine testing programme from autumn 2020.Care home staff no longer need to take a weekly PCR test, while free lateral flow tests will only be provided in limited circumstances.Care Inspectorate Wales figures also show 51 care homes in Wales have notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in the last week.School absences for Covid-related reasons are no longer being recorded. We saw over the 2021-22 academic year, 69.1% of pupils missed at least half a day's schooling because of Covid.Meanwhile, absence in general was much higher than in previous years - running at an average of 11% in primary-aged pupils and 16.3% in secondary-aged children during the 2021-22 academic year.This was more than twice the absence rate in pre-pandemic years.Analysis of these figures showed 10% were persistently absent - and this rose to 21% of those from poorer backgrounds.In the financial year ending in March 2021, the first year of the pandemic, spending on infectious diseases in the NHS in Wales jumped by £373 million.That worked out at £156 per person in Wales, or just under 6% of all NHS Wales spending.The costing of treating patients with Covid and managing the virus was put at £628m. Spending also included field hospitals and operating the track and trace system.","Date":"2023-01-20 13:19:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-wales-52380643","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/180AD/production/_127777489_mediaitem127777488.jpg"},{"Topic":"Coronavirus","Title":"Covid: Half a million missed out on heart drugs","Article":"During the pandemic, nearly half a million people in the UK missed out on starting medication to help prevent heart attacks and strokes, a new study suggests.The British Heart Foundation (BHF) team looked at prescribing data for the first 18 months after Covid hit.Some 491,000 people - 27,000 a month - appear to have missed out on blood pressure pills. And 316,000 did not get treatment to lower their cholesterol. The team says more needs to be done to make sure that anyone who needs treatment gets it. During the pandemic, normal NHS services were severely disrupted. For example, there was a reduction in diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of high blood pressure, and other heart and circulation disease risk factors.Although the NHS took action, including providing more than 220,000 blood pressure monitors for people to use at home, data shows two million fewer people in England were recorded as having controlled hypertension in 2021 compared to the previous year.The BHF researchers analysed 1.32 billion records of routinely dispensed prescriptions in England, Scotland and Wales, from April 2018 to July 2021. Lead investigator Prof Reecha Sofat, who is based at the University of Liverpool, said the findings, published in the journal Nature Medicine, highlight the impact Covid has had on other important health conditions: \"Despite the incredible work done by NHS staff, our data show that we're still not identifying people with cardiovascular risk factors at the same rate as we were before the pandemic. \"She said it was more than just a blip, and it would take time to catch up. \"The NHS has already taken important and positive steps towards identifying people with high blood pressure as early as possible. \"However, we need this focus to be sustained in the long term to prevent any increase in heart attacks and strokes which will add to a healthcare system already under extreme pressure.\" Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation and consultant cardiologist, said: \"Yet again we're seeing clear evidence of the major disruption to healthcare people in the UK experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic.  \"But it's not too late to limit the damage. These findings demonstrate how getting heart healthcare back on track can curb the additional strain that untreated risk factors - such as high blood pressure - would otherwise place on the NHS.\"Some factors - like older age - are unavoidable, but others can be managed:Adam Toms was 47 when he suffered a stroke in 2015. He had undiagnosed and untreated high blood pressure. Now 54 and living in north-west London, Mr Toms said: \"You can appear completely healthy, and it can just happen. then you've got a whole lot of adaptations to make. I was never ill but then bang, everything changed - my whole world changed.\"My father and my brother had high blood pressure. The connection wasn't made. \"I always associated a stroke with somebody who is 70, 75 plus.\"Who knows, if I had found out earlier and got it under control, I might not be where I am today.\"His stroke has left him with weakness on the left side of his body and he also has difficulty with finding the right words when he speaks.He wants to encourage others to get their blood pressure and health checked.","Date":"2023-01-20 02:38:00.000Z","Url":"/news/health-64330670","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0FFE/production/_128349040_gettyimages-1420937652.jpg"},{"Topic":"Climate","Title":"Biden green subsidies could harm trade, says Shapps","Article":"Business Secretary Grant Shapps has warned that US President Joe Biden's green subsidies could herald a \"dangerous\" slide into protectionism.The $430bn (£350bn) scheme includes tax credits for green technologies aimed at attracting investment to the US. Last month International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch wrote to her US counterpart complaining it would \"harm multiple economies across the world\". The EU, Canada and South Korea have all argued it breaches world trade rules.Under the Inflation Reduction Act, American consumers will get incentives to buy new and second-hand electric cars, to warm their homes with heat pumps, and to cook using electric induction.But the European Union has described the package as anti-competitive and a threat to European jobs, particularly in the energy and auto sectors.Taking part in a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Shapps said he did not believe the Act was designed to be protectionist, but that could be the result if it was not amended.Protectionist measures have the effect of restricting imports from other countries through tariffs or quotas on imported goods, or other regulations - generally with the aim of shielding domestic businesses and workers from foreign competition. Critics argue that protectionism reduces global trade and increases prices for consumers.   Mr Shapps said: \"We are great global traders. We want the world to be as open as possible. It is very, very important that we don't slip into protectionism. \"That is where, at the edges, the Inflation Reduction Act in the US is dangerous because it could slip into protectionism... I think that's where we have to be really careful.\"However, speaking during a separate session in Davos, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Biden administration's green subsidies should be seen not as a challenge - but as \"the single biggest opportunity\" for a new economic strategy in the UK. He described the US scheme as a \"catalyst for all of us... to transition to take the jobs and opportunities of the future\". In September, Sir Keir announced plans to create a publicly-owned renewable energy company, Great British Energy, if Labour won the next general election.In December, Ms Badenoch warned the Act would adversely affect supply chains in batteries, electric vehicles and wider renewables. Also last month, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU had to work with the US \"to address some of the most concerning aspects of the law\".She called on the EU to adjust its own rules on state aid to spur public investment in green technologies. This latest transatlantic spat comes after US labour secretary Marty Walsh criticised the UK government's bill imposing minimum service levels during strikes in some sectors, including the ambulance and fire services, and the railways.Under the bill, outlined in the Commons by Mr Shapps, some employees would be required to work during a strike and could be sacked if they refuse.Speaking in Davos on Wednesday, Mr Walsh told the BBC: \"I would not support anything that would take away from workers.\"Downing Street responded by saying the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill did not inhibit the ability of unions to strike - whereas, in the US, President Biden had taken action to block a walkout by rail workers.","Date":"2023-01-20 11:18:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-politics-64332962","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1448C/production/_128348038_de451fe88d9bbdec164e5a90c98aeedb2a90c5ab.jpg"},{"Topic":"Climate","Title":"The race to make diesel engines run on hydrogen","Article":"It's a new hydrogen-diesel hybrid engine affectionately known as \"baby number two\" that could help to decarbonise some of Australia's heaviest industries.The test rig is large - it has its own room adjoining a lab and looks at first glance like many other large motors, but beneath its metallic skin could lie game-changing technology.Engineers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) say they have successfully modified a conventional diesel engine to use a mix of hydrogen and a small amount of diesel, claiming their patented technology has cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by more than 85%.It's the work of Prof Shawn Kook and his team at the university's School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering.\"The interest in converting an existing diesel engine into a clean-burning hydrogen engine is extremely high,\" Prof Kook tells the BBC at his laboratory in Sydney. Enquiries have come from Germany, South Africa, Brazil, Japan and China.\"We mount the hydrogen direct injection system into existing diesel engines, which can be applied to any conventional engine,\" he adds. What makes their system unique, according to Prof Kook, is the way it mixes the hydrogen and diesel and then introduces it to the engine cylinder for combustion. Unlike fossil fuels, hydrogen does not produce CO2 when burnt, so it has long been seen as a greener fuel source.About 90% of fuel in the UNSW hybrid diesel engine is hydrogen but it must be applied in a carefully calibrated way. If the hydrogen is not introduced into the fuel mix at the right moment \"it will create something that is explosive that will burn out the whole system,\" Prof Kook explains.  He says that studies have shown that controlling the mixture of hydrogen and air inside the cylinder of the engine can help negate harmful nitrogen oxide emissions, which have been an obstacle to the commercialisation of hydrogen motors.The Sydney research team believes that any diesel trucks and power equipment in the mining, transportation and agriculture sectors could be retrofitted with the new hybrid system in just a couple of months.Prof Kook doubts the hybrid would be of much interest in the car industry though, where electric and hybrid vehicles are already advanced and replacing diesel cars.However, he says Australia's multibillion-dollar mining industry needs a solution for all its diesel-powered equipment as soon as possible.\"We have so many established diesel-powered generators, mega-trucks and underground machines. How do we decarbonise all those existing diesel engines? One way is to shut down everything and get new technology in, which will take decades,\" he says.  The plan is for the hybrid to run off a hydrogen-diesel mix or, in the absence of hydrogen, it can revert to diesel only. Prof Kook hopes his new generation engine will become a commercial product within two years.  Tim Buckley, the director at Climate Energy Finance, a public interest think-tank in Sydney, believes the technology has the potential to \"transform the Australian mining industry dramatically\".\"There's always an element of scepticism in the work I do to evaluate what is hype and hope as opposed to reality. Having said that, this University of New South Wales breakthrough does appear to be pretty material. If they can pull it off it is a huge opportunity,\" he says. More technology of business:The Australian team is in a global race to develop hybrid diesel-hydrogen engines. Engineers in other countries are working on their concepts and designs but the Sydney team believes it has an edge.\"I think we have a breakthrough compared to most other research groups in the world where we can actually achieve a higher percentage using hydrogen over diesel,\" explains Xinyu Liu, a UNSW PhD student from China. \"Emission-wise, CO2-wise we can achieve a higher reduction than the other methods. The concept has been proven using the previous small-scale engine. We are trying to implement this idea into a larger scale, which is more [applicable] to industry.\"  The bigger version, or the UNSW's \"baby number two\", has twice the volume of the original prototype and has the potential for a \"massive reduction in CO2\" emissions, according to Prof Kook.The vision is laid out in a paper published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.Much of the invention's impact on the environment will depend on where the hydrogen comes from.While small amounts of hydrogen are being extracted directly from the ground, most hydrogen is manufactured, in a process that emits CO2.Green hydrogen, produced by using electricity from renewable power to split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules using an electrolyser, is seen as the answer. But the technology and the electricity needed is costly, so at the moment only a small amount of hydrogen is produced this way.But the costs are likely to come down and with abundant sunshine and wind, Australia has a lot of potential to produce renewable electricity, which could one day be used to make more green hydrogen.The Climate Council, an independent organisation, believes that sustainable hydrogen gives Australia the chance to end its reliance on fossil fuels.\"Australia is one of the world's largest coal exporters and the largest liquefied gas exporter,\" the Council wrote in a 2021 briefing. \"Both are polluting fossil fuels, and Australia is paying a high cost for that with more severe and frequent extreme weather events like bushfires, heatwaves, and drought.\"For now, the UNSW project remains in the nursery in the laboratory. Academic endeavour needs the financial heft of outside investment and the hands-on input and knowledge of a mining company or engine manufacturer.\"Our vision is to impact Australian mining, agriculture and construction industries first and then move out to the rest of the world to make a bigger impact,\" says Prof Kook.Australia has some of the world's biggest resources companies and they have all committed to aggressive decarbonisation targets. Technology is the key.\"The idea of blending hydrogen and diesel together in an existing engine is something of a Holy Grail for decarbonising heavy industry and mining,\" adds Tim Buckley.He has this existential question for the engineers at UNSW: \"Can they actually deploy it in a commercial setting and replicate it outside the university?\"","Date":"2023-01-20 00:23:00.000Z","Url":"/news/business-64248564","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B96B/production/_128276474_dominik-vanyi-1hedpbh6hie-unsplash.jpg"},{"Topic":"World","Title":"President has 'no regrets' about classified documents","Article":"President Joe Biden said his team is doing what his lawyers have advised and that there is \"no there there\" regarding classified documents found at his home and former office.

Governor Ron DeSantis' administration said the proposed course \"lacks educational value and is contrary to Florida law\". The course is being rolled out in a pilot programme by the US College Board to 60 high schools across the country. Officials did not specify what law the course breaks. The Florida Department of Education outlined its intent to block the course in a 12 January letter to the College Board, writing that the course violates state law. \"In the future, should the College Board be willing to come back to the table with lawful, historically accurate content, (the Department of Education) will always be willing to reopen the discussion,\" the letter said.The Advanced Placement (AP) African American studies course is the College Board's first new class since 2014. It is set to cover more than 400 years of African American history, touching on topics like literature, political science and geography. The course is part of a broader AP programme in US high schools, which gives students the chance to take college-level courses before graduation. A statement by a spokesperson for Florida's Republican governor DeSantis said the course \"leaves large, ambiguous gaps that can be filled with additional ideological material, which we will not allow\".\"If the College Board amends the course to comply, provides a full course curriculum, and incorporates historically accurate content, then the Department will reconsider the course for approval,\" said spokesperson Bryan Griffin in a statement to media. In response, the College Board said the course is \"undergoing a rigorous, multi-year pilot phase, collecting feedback from teachers, students, scholars and policymakers\". \"We look forward to bringing this rich and inspiring exploration of African-American history and culture to students across the country,\" the board said.The decision to block the African American studies course has been met with outrage from the National Parents Union, who said the ban is a \"direct attack on the Black and all (Black, Indigenous and Persons of Colour) communities\". \"This behaviour is dangerous and should concern every American,\" the organisation said, adding they will challenge the decision. The ban was also criticised by Florida's state senator and Democrat Shevrin Jones, who wrote on Twitter that other AP courses, like European History and several language and culture courses, are still being taught in the state.\"It's crazy how AP African-American studies made the chopping block in FL,\" Mr Jones wrote. Last year, Gov DeSantis passed a \"Stop WOKE\" act that regulates how lessons on race and gender are taught in Florida schools.\"In Florida, we are taking a stand against the state-sanctioned racism that is critical race theory,\" Mr DeSantis said, citing the academic framework that denotes the existence of systemic racism in American society. However, one of the developers of the AP African American studies course had previously told Time magazine that the class does not teach \"critical race theory\". Rather, Henry-Louis Gates Jr, a leading scholar on African American history in the US, said the course \"is a mainstream, rigorously vetted, academic approach to a vibrant field of study\". Ron DeSantis has been assembling the kind of record on hot-button conservative issues that could form the core of a presidential campaign later this year.He repeatedly criticised government mandates to control the spread of Covid-19 and has expanded his attacks to include the development of the coronavirus vaccines. He railed against big corporations, including Florida powerhouse Disney, for catering to liberal interests and ideologies. He's accused social media companies of bias against conservatives. The topic Mr DeSantis appears most focused on, however, is education. He enthusiastically backed state legislation limiting the ability of school teachers to talk about LGBTQ issues in their classrooms. He's supported conservative candidates for local education boards and appointed controversial conservative activists as university trustees. He's called for a ban on transgender athletes in interscholastic competitions. His latest move, blocking the use of an advanced African American Studies curriculum in Florida public high schools, is just one piece of this larger puzzle. If Mr DeSantis runs for president, his pitch to primary voters is that he is the Republican who takes real action on conservative concerns- the kind of culture-war red meat that is a staple on right-wing media outlets.","Date":"2023-01-20 15:23:00.000Z","Url":"/news/world-us-canada-64348902","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DAE4/production/_128363065_gettyimages-1244625492.jpg"},{"Topic":"World","Title":"Guyana profile - Media","Article":"The constitution guarantees freedom of speech, although officials are apt to use defamation laws to silence opposition journalists, says Reporters Without Borders.Broadcasting legislation adopted in 2017 was criticised by some local media owners and press freedom groups.

He previously served in the role between 2017 and 2020, and therefore played a part in the Brexit talks that ultimately led to the creation of the protocol. While the protocol has been in place for more than a year, it remains a point of contention with talks continuing between the UK and EU to find a resolution. It is an agreement between the EU and UK which allows goods to be transported across the Irish land border without the need for checks.Before Brexit, it was easy to transport goods across this border because both sides followed the same EU rules but, after the UK left, special trading arrangements were needed so that this could still happen.The EU has strict food rules and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries.The land border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's troubled political history. It was feared that cameras or border posts - as part of these checks - could lead to instability.Unionist parties argue that placing an effective border across the Irish Sea undermines Northern Ireland's place within the UK. In protest against the protocol Paul Givan, former leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), resigned as first minister in February 2022, collapsing the power-sharing agreement. Since then, there has been no devolved government in Northern Ireland.Under Northern Ireland's power-sharing system of government, introduced in the 1990s as a way of ending decades of violence, Sinn Féin - which became the biggest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly last year - cannot nominate its first minister until the DUP puts forward a nomination for the position of deputy first minister. The DUP is refusing to do under its ongoing protest against Brexit trading arrangements.Asked by the BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam whether anything could have been done differently during the protocol talks, Mr Varadkar said his main regret was that the measure had been \"imposed on Northern Ireland without the support of both communities\".\"In the same way Brexit was imposed on Northern Ireland without the support of both communities, the protocol was imposed on Northern Ireland without the support of two communities,\" he said, laying some blame on the fact Northern Ireland's government \"was not functioning\".But Mr Varadkar said the protocol was working economically and that the absence of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic was proof of this. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he also said Northern Ireland's economy was \"outperforming the UK economy\". Northern Ireland's economy did appear to be doing better than the UK average on some measures last year.However, figures from the NI Statistics and Research Agency suggest it entered a technical recession - two consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output - at the end of the summer.The UK as a whole has so far avoided a technical recession, although UK and NI output figures are not directly comparable.But Mr Varadkar said he could understand why unionists and unionist politicians felt the protocol had \"lessened the links [and] weakened the union between Northern Ireland and Britain\" without them \"having a proper say as to how it operates\". Mr Varadkar's interview came amid an ongoing stalemate at Stormont, the Northern Ireland parliament. There has been no functioning devolved government at Stormont since February 2022 after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) withdrew from the institution in protest against the Protocol.The party has continued its boycott at Stormont and is demanding fundamental change to the protocol before it considers a return to the assembly.Mr Varadkar said he hoped a fresh agreement between the EU and UK could be reached \"sooner rather than later\", describing UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as someone he believed would \"go about doing business and getting things done\".\"The possibility of an agreement... in the next couple of months is very real and, with reasonableness and flexibility on both sides, it can be achieved,\" he added. Responding to his comments, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: \"The Northern Ireland Protocol has never had the support of unionists and never will enjoy unionist support. It was imposed against the will of unionists.\"Whilst the Taoiseach's comments are welcome, rather than focus on the past, London, Dublin and Brussels must now redouble their efforts on replacing the protocol with arrangements that unionists can support.\"","Date":"2023-01-20 14:41:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-politics-64337106","ImgUrl":""},{"Topic":"World","Title":"Serbia profile","Article":"Television is, by far, the main source of news and information.

Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed has been in Kabul for a four-day visit to urge the Taliban to reconsider. Last month, the country's Islamist rulers banned all women from working for non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The move caused several aid agencies to suspended operations. Speaking to the BBC at the end of her trip, Ms Mohammed said most senior Taliban officials she met had been ready to engage over the rights of girls and women. However, she described the talks as tough and cautioned that it would be a very long journey before the leadership took the fundamental steps required for international recognition of their rule.  \"I think there are many voices we heard, which are progressive in the way that we would like to go,\" Ms Mohammed said. \"But there are others that really are not.\"\"I think the pressure we put in the support we give to those that are thinking more progressively is a good thing. So this visit, I think, gives them more voice and pressure to help the argument internally.\"Ms Mohammed also criticised the international community, including other Islamic states, for not doing enough to engage on the issue. Since seizing back control of the country last year, the Taliban has steadily restricted women's rights - despite promising its rule would be softer than the regime seen in the 1990s.As well as the ban on female university students - now being enforced by armed guards - secondary schools for girls remain closed in most provinces.Women have also been prevented from entering parks and gyms, among other public places.It justified the move to ban Afghan women from working for NGOs by claiming female staff had broken dress codes by not wearing hijabs.Ms Mohammed's comments come as Afghanistan suffers its harshest winter in many years.The Taliban leadership blames sanctions and the refusal of the international community to recognise their rule for the country's deepening crisis.Ms Mohammed said her message to Afghanistan's rulers was that they must first demonstrate their commitment to internationally recognised norms and that humanitarian aid cannot be provided if Afghan women are not allowed to help. \"They're discriminating against women there. for want of a better word, they become invisible, they're waiting them out, and that can't happen,\" she said.But she said the Taliban's stance was that the UN and aid organisations were \"politicising humanitarian aid\".\"They believe that... the law applies to anyone anywhere and their sovereign rights should be respected,\" she said.The Taliban health ministry has clarified that women can work in the health sector, where female doctors and nurses are essential, but Ms Mohammed said this was not enough.\"There are many other services that we didn't get to do with access to food and other livelihood items that that will allow us to see millions of women and their families survive a harsh winter, be part of growth and prosperity, peace,\" she said.This visit by the most senior woman at the UN also sends a message that women can and should play roles at all levels of society.","Date":"2023-01-20 12:42:00.000Z","Url":"/news/world-asia-64341817","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/128C7/production/_128357957_gettyimages-1246328215.jpg"},{"Topic":"Africa","Title":"SA netball to 'test ourselves' ahead of World Cup","Article":"","Date":"2023-01-20 11:40:00.000Z","Url":"/sport/africa/64347387","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/5218/production/_128361012_whatsubject.jpg"},{"Topic":"Africa","Title":"‘I just love playing’ – the old man of African football","Article":"","Date":"2023-01-20 11:10:00.000Z","Url":"/sport/africa/64325786","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/16F4A/production/_128362049_arkrourmain.jpg"},{"Topic":"Africa","Title":"Guinea's Ebola orphans 'rejected while suffering'","Article":"This year marks a decade since the largest ever outbreak of Ebola began, which killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa.

It said it would \"defend its position\".The company noted that while it was aware of reports about the lawsuit, it had not yet received the claim.It also said that it was never a majority owner of the Kabwe mine. But lawyers representing the victims allege that AASA is liable because of its role \"controlling, managing, supervising and advising on the technical, medical and safety aspects of the mine's operations\".The Kabwe mine was nationalised and operated as a state-owned body for 20 years before its closure in 1994. The lawsuit was filed in a South African court on Wednesday. It calls for financial compensation, medical screening of children and women, and a clean-up of the area.Lawyers said the claimants, who are \"principally young children\", were suffering from \"alarming levels of lead poisoning\".They said victims have experienced a range of conditions, including psychological damage, and damage to their organs. \"In pregnant women, lead they ingested as children is absorbed into their bones and released during pregnancy,\" they said. In a report last year, Human Rights Watch said more than one-third of the population of Kabwe - more than 76,000 people - live in lead-contaminated areas.There have been several major attempts to clean up the area since the mine was closed in 1994. But Kabwe's \"Black Mountain\" - millions of tons of waste - remains in place, the BBC's Andrew Harding reports.In 2018, Anglo American was one of several mining companies to agree a compensation deal for tens of thousands of South African miners who contracted deadly lung diseases while working underground.AASA also settled a compensation claim brought by 23 former gold miners in the country in 2013.","Date":"2023-01-20 10:07:00.000Z","Url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-54634511","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2A96/production/_115020901_p065yy3k.jpg"},{"Topic":"Africa","Title":"","Article":"","Date":"2023-01-20 07:36:00.000Z","Url":"https://www.martinennalsaward.org/chad-venezuela-and-kashmir-to-receive-the-martin-ennals-award-2023/","ImgUrl":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="},{"Topic":"Africa","Title":"","Article":"Visitors to Rwanda are often blown away to find a country where things seem to work efficiently. It is neat and tidy with lush green views - and the wi-fi is good in the capital, Kigali. Everyone tends to pay their taxes; services are reliable; the roads are safe - the government calls it \"one of the world's safest nations\".Take the pandemic for example. Rwanda did not hesitate to take coronavirus by the horns: lockdowns were implemented quickly and enforced strictly. Today more than 60% of the population is vaccinated - something the British Medical Journal calls a feat \"in a continent that is a Covid-19 vaccine desert\".But underlying this compliance and Kigali's landscaped flower beds is a collective fear.Walk into a bar and try to start up a controversial debate, and you will be shut down - and there is every likelihood your behaviour will be reported to the authorities. Those deemed a real threat will be dealt with harshly.\"It does look like the Switzerland of Africa but it is an extremely repressive and frightening country,\" Michela Wrong, author of a recent book on Rwanda called Do Not Disturb, told the BBC.On the last Saturday of every month, everyone gets together in their neighbourhoods to do a collective clean-up - roads are swept, rubbish collected. It is called Umuganda, which in Kinyarwanda means \"Community Work\".One Rwandan, who asked not to be named, explains there is no law that forces people to attend the Umuganda - but there is a fear you will gain a reputation, that someone will report you, that your name will be logged as a troublemaker.Any camp that asylum seekers are sent to under the new UK deal is likely to be a well-organised affair - not the refugee camps you sometimes see with tents or plastic sheeting tacked on to thorns.The country, which has a population of 13 million, has already taken in more than 900 African asylum seekers from Libya since 2019 - under a deal with the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and the African Union (AU).They have been housed at Gashora, about 60km (40 miles) from Kigali. The UNHCR says it is not a refugee camp, but an Emergency Transit Mechanism - and more than half of them have already been relocated to Sweden, Canada, Norway, France and Belgium.The UN site, which has permanent structures, aims to teach those who suffered appalling conditions in Libyan camps, the skills to help them in their new life. The camp has a driving school and offers language classes, amongst other things.But when Denmark announced last year that it was planning a similar deal to the one the UK has just launched, the AU hit out.\"Such attempts to stem out migration from Africa to Europe is xenophobic and completely unacceptable,\" it said last August.Africa already shouldered 85% of the world's refugees \"often in protracted situations, whereas only 15% are hosted by developed countries\", it said.Wrong calls it a \"cynical and amoral deal\".\"It's all about sending a deterrent to asylum seekers… anyone who is trying to flee repression in Africa is going to be horrified at being sent to Rwanda,\" she said.Unlike the UNHCR project, details being released of the UK scheme suggest asylum seekers would be in Rwanda for longer - \"so that they can resettle and thrive\", as the home secretary put it.It is not clear how many people Rwanda is expecting to accept, given it is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa but UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would take \"tens of thousands in the years ahead\".Out of Kigali, Wrong says it is a \"poor agrarian society where every inch of fertile land is being cultivated and which doesn't really have room to take refugees\".No-one expects much opposition at home to the move - as critics of 64-year-old Paul Kagame, who led the rebel forces which ended the 1994 genocide and has been president since 2000, tend to regret it.Last month, Human Rights Watch issued a report about the prosecution over the last year of at least eight YouTubers considered to be critical of the government. One, who filmed and criticised soldiers forcefully expelling residents during a slum clearance, has been sentenced to seven years in jail.Critics who flee the country have been pursued and assassinated by Rwandan agents in exile - or in the case of Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager who saved the lives of more than 1,000 people during the genocide and on whom the Hollywood film Hotel Rwanda was based, put on trial.After the genocide - in which 800,000 people were killed - Rusesabagina became a Belgian citizen and used his fame to speak out against what he said was President Kagame's repressive rule.But in 2020, his family says he was abducted while passing through Dubai and taken to Rwanda and has been convicted to 25 years in jail for backing a rebel group.His daughter, Carine Kanimba, told the BBC it showed Rwanda had zero respect for human rights: \"Rwanda is a dictatorship, there is no freedom of speech, there is no democracy. In the last election the president won the elections by 99%, which tells you this is not a democracy.\"I don't understand why the British government would decide to send vulnerable people to a country that is known to oppress its own people.\"The reason perhaps lies at the door of Mr Kagame, who stands more than 6ft, is a charismatic, Arsenal football club-loving, driven man. Many Western leaders - those who may feel the guilt of not doing more to stop the genocide that defines Rwanda for many outsiders - are enamoured by him.\"He's very good at identifying the issues that keep Western leaders awake at night and presenting them with a solution which seems to be effective and cut-price,\" says Wrong, pointing to how Rwandan troops were sent to Mozambique last year to deal with a jihadist insurgency.Last year, Mr Kagame said he was offering refugee centres on \"humanitarian grounds\". One of Rwanda's few opposition parties has said it is all about money.Western nations are impressed by Rwanda's rapid economic development since the genocide and by the fact corruption appears not to be an issue - though donors do issue human rights warnings.The UK Conservative party's love affair with Rwanda started in 2007, while in opposition, with something called Project Umubano, founded by Andrew Mitchell.The former development minister organised for MPs to fly out each August to work on development projects - and coach cricket.A cricket charity linked to the project began raising funds and a few years ago the state-of-the-art Gahanga Cricket Stadium, also known as the Kicukiro Oval, was opened just outside Kigali.Some see the asylum-seeker deal as part of a sophisticated strategy to improve Rwanda's image, as the country gears up to host the Commonwealth summit this June.But Rwanda's government spokesperson dismissed its critics, saying no-one was persecuted in Rwanda for having an opinion\"We know the kind of situations that people from countries like that have been through and this is a place where they will be safe, they will be protected and can live dignified lives and have an opportunity to develop their talents,\" Yolande Makolo told the BBC.You may also be interested in:","Date":"2023-01-20 04:38:00.000Z","Url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-61111915","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10C3A/production/_124166686_gettyimages-521786704.jpg"},{"Topic":"Australia","Title":"Australia rugby star charged over alleged sex assault","Article":"Australian rugby union player Kurtley Beale has reportedly been charged over an allegation he sexually assaulted a woman in a Sydney pub last month.Police say they are investigating reports that a 28-year-old woman was attacked in beachside suburb Bondi on 17 December.Mr Beale, 34, has played more than 90 games for Australia's national team, the Wallabies, over 10 years.He was recently named in the Wallabies training squad for the World Cup.In a statement, New South Wales Police said they arrested a man on Friday afternoon over the allegation and have charged him with two counts of sexually touching another person without consent, inciting another to sexually touch them without consent and sexual intercourse without consent.

The state-run gas monopoly Gazprom still supplies a large share of Europe's needs.Vladimir Putin - Russia's dominant political figure since 2000 - has enhanced his control over state institutions and the media - a process supplemented more recently by an emphasis on fierce nationalism and hostility to the West.This led to his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, in an attempt to re-assert Russian control over the neighbouring country.President: Vladimir PutinVladimir Putin has been Russia's dominant political figure since his election as president in 2000, serving two terms and then a four-year stint as prime minister, before resuming the presidency in 2012 and winning re-election in 2018.Since his re-election against only token opposition, Russia's authorities have further tightened control over the media, thereby muffling an embryonic opposition movement. He has also and adopted a stridently nationalist course and appealed to memories of Soviet-era power to shore up domestic support.The president presents himself as a strong leader who took Russia out of the economic, social and political crisis of the 1990s, and defends Russia's national interests, particularly against alleged Western hostility. Opponents and critics at home and abroad accuse him of undermining Russia's institutions, halting democratic development, and entrenching rule by a narrow, wealthy elite.Russian TV is dominated by channels that are either run directly by the state or owned by companies with close links to the Kremlin.The government controls Channel One and Russia One - two of the three main federal channels - while state-controlled energy giant Gazprom owns NTV.The internet is less tightly controlled than traditional media, but the authorities have extended their control over the online world and are keen to curb the influence of global internet giants.Some key dates in Russia's history:1547 - Grand Prince Ivan IV of Moscow (Ivan the Terrible) is the first ruler to be proclaimed Tsar of Russia. 1689-1725 - Peter the Great introduces far-reaching reforms. 1798-1815 - Russia takes part in the European coalitions against Revolutionary and Napoleonic France, defeating Napoleon's invasion in 1812 and contributing to his overthrow.1853-57 - Russia suffers setback in attempt to seize territory from declining Ottoman Empire through its defeat in Crimean War.1904-05 - Russian expansion in Manchuria leads to war with Japan - and the 1905 revolution, which forced Tsar Nicholas II to grant a constitution and establish a parliament, the Duma.1914 - Russian-Austrian rivalry in Balkans contributes to outbreak of World War One, in which Russia fights alongside Britain and France.1917 - Nicholas II abdicates. Bolshevik revolutionaries led by Lenin topple the provisional government and take power. 1918-22 - Civil war between Red Army and anti-communist White Russians. 1922 - Bolsheviks reorganise remnants of Russian Empire as Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.1945 - Allied victory over Nazi Germany is followed by swift establishment of Soviet hegemony in Central and Eastern Europe, and Balkans. The end of the war sees the start of decades of Cold War rivalry with the West. 1953 - Death of dictator Joseph Stalin ushers in less repressive rule at home, although Communist Party political dominance is firmly upheld.1991 - Russia becomes independent as the Soviet Union collapses and, together with Ukraine and Belarus, forms the Commonwealth of Independent States, which is eventually joined by most former Soviet republics.2000 - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin takes over as president on the resignation of Boris Yeltsin, begins steady re-orientation of Russia away from democracy and cooperation with the West towards a more nationalist and authoritarian politics.2014 - Russia seizes Ukrainian region of Crimea. 2015 - Russia begins armed intervention in Syria to support ally President Bashar al-Assad.2022 - Russia invades Ukraine, prompting the biggest East-West showdown since the Cold War.","Date":"2023-01-20 11:28:00.000Z","Url":"/news/world-europe-17839672","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/693D/production/_128214962_bbcm_russia_country_profile_with-flag_050123.jpg"},{"Topic":"Europe","Title":"Russia profile","Article":"Television is the most powerful sector of the media industry and the main news source for most Russians, although its dominance is being eroded by the internet.The top national TV networks are either state-run or owned by companies with close links to the Kremlin.

The thriving pay-TV market is led by the satellite platform Tricolor.RT, launched in 2005 as the state-funded English-language TV station Russia Today, is the flagship of Russia's international media operations. RT also operates TV networks in Arabic, Spanish and French.News and current affairs shows on mainstream TV are dominated by pro-Kremlin messages and denigration of the West. There are more than 3,000 licensed radio stations. The three main state networks Radio Rossii, Mayak and Vesti FM compete with music-based commercial stations.Of the 16,000 registered newspapers, 22 can be described as national titles. The most popular papers are pro-Kremlin, and several influential dailies are owned by companies with close links to the Kremlin.Major newspaper publishers have weathered a decline in print circulations by becoming multimedia operations.There is widespread suppression of politically sensitive material in much of the media.

I think he was just trying to find girls who were as innocent or naïve as possible, in my opinion.\" She showed us a screenshot of the message, which she never replied to.  But she says some of her friends did.Daria, who's now at university in the UK, is the daughter of a prominent Romanian politician and feels able to speak out publicly when others have refused to go on the record.The Tate brothers are currently in 30-day custody in Romania while police investigate allegations of rape and trafficking, which both men deny.In video posted online Andrew Tate appears to instruct others on how to approach women on social media. \"In my experience, what raises intrigue [and] inspires them to respond [is]… I ask where they are,\" he says in the recording. \"Sometimes [for] intrigue, I'll put a completely pointless emoji on the end: some cherries, or an orange, or a strawberry.\"Since sharing her experiences, Daria says many young men have accused her of lying.\"Even guys that I used to know from high school are calling me a liar for saying I once received a message from Andrew Tate,\" she told me. \"But [they] don't find anything strange about all the other allegations.\"She says many men of her age idolise Andrew Tate, who is 36.\"This is a big problem,\" she told me, \"because we can't wake up in 20 years with two million Andrew Tates.\"In publicity for his online courses, in manipulating and exploiting women, Andrew Tate said: \"I've been running a web-cam studio for over a decade… Over 50% of my employees were actually my girlfriends at the time and, of all my girlfriends, NONE were in the adult entertainment industry before they met me.\"He describes his job as \"to meet a girl, go on a few dates, sleep with her… get her to fall in love with me, to where she'd do anything I say,\" the publicity continues, \"and then get her on web-cam so we could become rich together.\"He has previously said he would never date a woman over 25.Gabriela (not her real name) was 17 when she was contacted on social media by Andrew Tate's brother Tristan - though she later pretended she was 19.She's asked that we call her Gabriela to disguise her identity.She showed me his initial message, which read, \"You're beautiful\".\"I knew he was using the same approach with other girls,\" she said. \"He always starts the conversation with the same exact line: 'You're beautiful'.\"Gabriela said a friend of hers received exactly the same opening message from Tristan Tate.In his video online, Andrew Tate says the phrase '\"you are beautiful\" isn't bad as an opening, and goes on to outline what he describes as \"a perfect example\" of a conversation.After establishing where the woman is, Mr Tate advises men to ask: \"Why do I never see you? Where are you hiding?\"\"99% of them say [they're] not hiding,\" he says in the recording.This is exactly what appears to have happened in the exchange with Gabriela.Screenshots of what is purported to be her conversation with Tristan Tate show his next message is exactly as Andrew describes: \"Feel I've seen you around town before somewhere. Is that possible? Where have you been hiding?\"\"It is likely,\" Gabriela replies. \"I didn't hide.\"Gabriela says he invited her out in his car, and to a party, though she declined. Screenshots of their exchange indicate that the conversation ended abruptly after she posted a video about him on social media.\"Important people will never want to write you if they see you do stuff like this. Just a friendly warning,\" one of his last messages says.There is nothing illegal in the Tate brothers contacting girls of 16 or 17 online, or inviting them out. But the testimony of these young women, along with Andrew Tate's comments online, suggest a pre-planned method for initiating contact.The BBC has seen the screenshots that appear to support the claims made by these women. The messages appear to be sent from handles whose username matches that used by Andrew and Tristan Tate before they were banned from the application. However, the BBC has been unable to independently verify their authenticity, or establish whether the messages were sent by Andrew and Tristan Tate themselves or someone working on their behalf. The BBC has put these allegations to the Tate brothers through their lawyer, and asked for their response.Social media updates have continued to appear on Andrew Tate's accounts, even while he's in custody.On Thursday, he wrote that five people had been authorised to visit him in detention, including a 22-year-old American influencer called Adin Ross, with millions of followers, who said he was flying to Romania on Thursday.No charges have yet been brought against the Tate brothers. Their 30-day detention period is set to expire in just over a week.For all the confessional videos and commentary on their personal life, the allegations against them remain unproven; any evidence against them, veiled - for now - from public view.","Date":"2023-01-20 06:17:00.000Z","Url":"/news/world-europe-64330811","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/116E2/production/_128249317_5c3b04f8a957758dc3d36191506e4072e23272dd0_0_4372_29912000x1368.jpg"},{"Topic":"Latin America","Title":"Guadeloupe profile","Article":"Commercial broadcasters operate alongside services provided by public broadcaster Reseau France Outre-mer (RFO).There were 240,000 internet users by March 2019, 53.5% of the population.

Najat Saliba and Melhem Khalaf refused to leave the chamber after the latest round of voting, spending the night inside the darkened building. The outgoing president's term expired on 31 October and a replacement should have been voted in before he left.But Lebanon's various sectarian parties have still not agreed on a successor.\"No-one tried to remove us,\" Najat Saliba told the BBC. \"On the contrary, the parliament staff were very helpful and even opened meeting rooms for us in addition to the General Assembly hall. \"We spent the night without electricity, because it shuts down every day at 14:30 (12:30 GMT). But we received a lot of food from various people and other MPs who visited.\"Ms Saliba and Mr Khalaf - both from the Forces of Change bloc who entered parliament at the last election - say their sit-in will continue until a new president is finally agreed upon. They want fellow MPs to come and meet them to discuss potential candidates.\"This is our duty,\" Ms Saliba continued. \"Nothing in the constitution is working. The political system in Lebanon is in a state of gridlock and the walls between the parties are becoming thicker. We have no choice but to sit down and talk to destroy these walls that keep warlords in power.\"So far, each of the 11 electoral sessions to appoint a successor to former President Michel Aoun has ended in failure. In the latest parliamentary session, the most popular candidate, Michel Moawad, received just 34 votes, far fewer than the 86 needed to move to a second round. Thirty-seven MPs cast blank ballots and several others used their papers to make a protest. One even cast a vote for the US senator Bernie Sanders.The power vacuum in Lebanon also extends to the government. The country has only had a caretaker administration in place since national elections in May last year. The main parties failed to agree on a new coalition, so the previous cabinet continued in their jobs until a solution could be found. But without an official mandate, the government is unable to move ahead on dealing with Lebanon's crippling economic crisis.As MPs once again failed to break the presidential deadlock, Lebanon's currency reached a new record low. Fifty thousand Lebanese lira are now worth just $1 on the country's parallel market, or black market.For years, the exchange rate stood at a steady 1,500 lira to the dollar.

A friend and an inspiration. Awful news.\"Meanwhile, film producer Cassian Elwes said he was \"devastated\", adding that he had \"said many prayers\". For weeks, California has been battered by deadly storms and a disaster declaration was issued by President Joe Biden.Mr Sands was reported missing at about 19:30 local time on Friday 13 January.The department's search and rescue crews responded and began a search, but this was hampered by severe weather warnings and trail conditions.\"However, we continue to search by helicopter and drones when the weather permits,\" a statement said.The department said it had responded to 14 calls on Mount San Antonio, known locally as Mount Baldy, and in the surrounding area over the last four weeks. It warned hikers to \"stay away\" from that area. \"It is extremely dangerous and even experienced hikers are getting in trouble,\" the department said.

Start calculating how much every American man, woman and child owes. Cue the comparisons to a family budget, or credit-card spending or running a small business. The national debt - and the legally mandated cap on the amount of new debt the federal government can issue - are back in the headlines.First, a bit of context. The US government is in the enviable position of being able to issue new debt pretty much whenever it wants. American Treasury securities have been viewed as one of the safest, most stable investments in the modern world. In times of economic turbulence, US debt is a harbour in the storm. If the US issues new government debt in the form of Treasury bonds, bills, notes and securities, there will be investors, both in the US and abroad, who are interested buyers.While the current figures for the US debt - $31tn (£25tn) and growing - are astounding in both numerical and comparative terms, they do not represent an impending crisis.The US debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratio, typically a more illuminating measure of a nation's ability to manage its debt, sits at 128%.This is lower than more than a dozen of countries, including Japan, Greece and Italy.The dispute over the national debt, then, is not one of economics but of politics. Republicans are attempting to use a legal requirement that Congress set a cap on the amount of new debt the US Treasury can issue to force the White House and Democrats in the Senate to agree to sweeping spending cuts in exchange for an increase in the debt limit.That debt limit cap was first instituted by Congress in 1917, but increasing the amount was a formality for nearly a century.Republicans in 2011 first used the limit - and the threat of a US default on its debt obligations - to force then-President Barack Obama to the budget negotiating table.Their efforts were somewhat successful, as Mr Obama and the Republicans agreed to caps on government spending.Those caps were frequently ignored, however, and ultimately abandoned by the Republican-controlled Congress in 2018, which then increased discretionary spending by 16% (with the support of many Democrats).In fact, Congress raised or waived the debt limit three times during Donald Trump's presidency, standing in contrast to the debt battles during his predecessor's time in office.Now that a Democrat is back in the White House and one chamber of the Congress is in control of Republicans, the debt-limit battles have returned once again.

The system alerts pilots to potential hazards on flight routes. They are required to check it before flights.Lawmakers vowed to look into the issue.

Nevertheless, the controversial stamp was sold out on the first day of sales and the price tripled, according to local media.","Date":"2023-01-20 08:20:00.000Z","Url":"/news/world-asia-china-64342423","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/644B/production/_128357652_008uzq4jgy1haa0kt5yxyj30ii0opn4e.jpg"},{"Topic":"Asia","Title":"India government criticises BBC's Modi documentary","Article":"The Indian government has criticised a BBC documentary on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots.Foreign ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi said India: The Modi Question lacked objectivity and was propaganda.The first of the two-part series was aired in the UK on Tuesday. The second part will go out next Tuesday. The BBC said it was \"committed to highlighting important issues from around the world\".It added that the Indian government was offered a right to reply, but they declined.The first episode tracks Mr Modi's first steps into politics, including his rise through the ranks of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to his appointment as chief minister of the western state of Gujarat.The documentary highlights a previously unpublished report, obtained by the BBC from the British Foreign Office, which raises questions about Mr Modi's actions during the religious riots that had broken out after a train carrying Hindu pilgrims the day before was set on fire, killing dozens. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, died in the outbreak of violence, one of the worst since Independence.The report claims that Mr Modi was \"directly responsible\" for the \"climate of impunity\" that enabled the violence. Mr Modi has long rejected accusations that he had any responsibility for the violence and not apologised for the riots. In 2013, a Supreme Court panel also said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him. Mr Bagchi questioned the BBC's motive in doing the documentary now. \"It makes us wonder about the purpose of this exercise and the agenda behind it,\" he said.\"This is a propaganda piece designed to push a particular discredited narrative. The bias, the lack of objectivity, and a continuing colonial mindset, is blatantly visible,\" he added.In a statement, the broadcaster said: \"The documentary series examines the tensions between India's Hindu majority and Muslim minority and explores the politics of Mr Modi in relation to those tensions.\" It was \"rigorously researched\" and \"a wide range of voices, witnesses and experts were approached, and we have featured a range of opinions, including responses from people in the BJP\", it added. The report was part of an inquiry ordered by the then foreign secretary Jack Straw. It says that \"the extent of violence was much greater than reported\" and \"the aim of the riots was to purge Muslims from Hindu areas\". \"These were very serious claims that Mr Modi had played a proactive part in pulling back police and in tacitly encouraging the Hindu extremists. That was a particularly egregious example of political involvement to prevent police from doing their job to protect the Hindus and the Muslims,\" Mr Straw is heard saying in the documentary.Speaking on what action the British government could take at the time, he said, \"The options... were limited, we were never going to break diplomatic relations with India, but it is obviously a stain on his [Mr Modi's] reputation.\" On Thursday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was asked in parliament by MP Imran Hussain if he agreed with the report that Mr Modi was directly responsible for the violence and \"what more did the foreign office know of his involvement in this grave act of ethnic cleansing\"? Mr Sunak said \"we don't tolerate persecution anywhere\", but added that \"he did not agree with the characterisation\" of Mr Modi.","Date":"2023-01-20 08:11:00.000Z","Url":"/news/world-asia-india-64342679","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AED9/production/_127916744_gettyimages-1245051918-594x594.jpg"},{"Topic":"Asia","Title":"Hundreds evacuated from South Korea slum fire","Article":"Watch: Flames engulfed Guryong VillageHundreds of people have had to be evacuated after a fire broke out in a shanty town in South Korea's capital, Seoul. Roughly 60 homes are reported to have been destroyed in Friday morning's blaze in Guryong Village.There have been no reports of deaths or injuries.South Korean media has described the area of closely packed makeshift homes as the capital's last remaining slum.It took more than 900 firefighters and several helicopters five hours to put out the blaze.\"Right after I opened the door, I saw a pillar of fire rising from one side,\" one 72-year-old resident told Reuters. \"It looks really serious and I shouldn't escape alone. So, I banged on the doors and shouted 'Fire!' And people came out and screamed. It was chaotic.\"President Yoon Suk-yeol called for all-out efforts to minimise the damage and mobilise all available firefighters and equipment, according to his spokeswoman. Mr Yoon is currently in Switzerland for the World Economic Forum summit at Davos.The exact cause of the blaze is still unknown, but the area has also been prone to fires and floods, with many homes built using cardboard and wood. According to the Korea Times, Guryong Village has suffered at least 16 fires since 2009. It was formed in the 1980s by people evicted from their original neighbourhoods by redevelopment projects under the military government of the time, but efforts to develop the area have been frustrated by disagreements between local governing bodies and residents. Guryong Village is on the edge of the affluent Gangnam district, which has some of the country's most expensive real-estate.","Date":"2023-01-20 07:50:00.000Z","Url":"/news/world-asia-64343167","ImgUrl":""},{"Topic":"Asia","Title":"Japan inflation rate jumps to fresh 41-year high","Article":"Japan's inflation rate has jumped to a fresh 41-year high as businesses pass on higher costs to their customers.Core consumer prices for last month rose by 4% from a year earlier, double the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) target level.It puts further pressure on the central bank to put up its interest rates to help ease the rising cost of living.This week the BOJ surprised investors by announcing that it would keep rates near zero, despite the increasing cost of everything from food to fuel.\"Producer prices have been rising at a much faster pace than consumer prices for some time, but now companies are passing these costs on to consumers,\" Damian Thong, who heads Japan equity research at Macquarie Group, told the BBC.\"We believe that the BOJ will [eventually] end its negative interest rate policy,\" he added.Producer prices are a measure of inflation at a wholesale level, while consumer prices reflect how much is paid by households for goods and services.Official data released on Friday showed inflation was at its highest since 1981, the ninth month in a row that it has been above the central bank's 2% target.Even after the jump in prices, Japan still has one of the lowest inflation rates in the world.As a result the world's third largest economy has bucked the trend of many other countries that have raised interest rates sharply over the last year.On Wednesday the BOJ kept interest rates near zero, which pushed the yen down in value against other major currencies.Many experts had expected the central bank to start to phase out its economic stimulus programme in an attempt to curb rising prices.The latest official figures showed that inflation in the US stood at 6.5% in December, while it was 9.2% in the eurozone and 10.5% in the UK.Why are things so expensive?

Its birth rate had been slowing for years, prompting a range of policies to try to slow this trend, including scrapping the country's infamous one-child policy seven years ago.But there are no easy fixes to this conundrum, economists and demographers say, given the unique trajectory in which the Chinese population has aged in recent years.While ageing populations have posed a challenge to economies around the world, the greater concern for China is the rapid pace at which this has been unfolding in the midst of its middle-income transition.In short, China is getting old before it gets rich.Its statistics bureau said this week that its population had fallen for the first time in 60 years, with the birth rate also hitting a record low - to no surprise. Some researchers believe the population decline started in 2018 and census estimates have been inaccurate.In any case, China's working-age population has been on a slump since 2012. Its age-dependency ratio, which is the ratio of children and retired people to the working age population, has risen from 37.12% in 2010 to 44.14% in 2020.Based on UN estimates, the number of Chinese aged between 15 and 64 will fall by more than 60% this century.But Andrew Harris, deputy chief economist at Fathom Financial Consulting, said the country had a pool of cheap rural labour that could help fill manufacturing gaps in urban areas.There is still \"significant slack\" in the manufacturing and construction sectors, Mr Harris added, noting that Fathom estimates that roughly one third of workers in the construction sector are underemployed, which means they are producing less than they potentially could.\"The broader demographic story won't bite fully on China's growth until both of these sources of slack have been exhausted,\" he said. According to Paul Cheung, Singapore's former chief statistician, China has \"plenty of manpower\" and \"a lot of lead time\" to manage the demographic challenge.\"They are not in a doomsday scenario right away,\" Prof Cheung said.He also pointed to how countries like Japan and Singapore had managed to provide a safety net for their ageing citizenry while maintaining relative economic stability. But not everyone is as sanguine. \"The major difference between China and countries like South Korea and Japan is that its demographic (stress is) biting at much lower levels of income,\" Mr Harris said.A 2019 report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences predicted that the country's main pension fund would be depleted by 2035, in part because of its shrinking workforce.Studies by US think-tank Pew Research showed that some seven in 10 people in China already felt its public health system was under strain in 2016. A greying population and the spiralling Covid crisis have placed additional stresses on it.China's population decline could send ripple effects across the global economy. For one, a shrinking workforce means rising labour costs, which could increase consumption and production costs. Recent reports have already shown China - long dubbed the \"factory of the world\" - losing manufacturing operations to other developing countries in Asia and South America. \"China's shrinking labour force and manufacturing recession will lead to high prices and high inflation in the US and EU,\" said Yi Fuxian, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and longtime critic of China's now-defunct one-child policy.Given how its recent attempts to raise fertility rates have met with limited success, China may have to look at other ways to sustain growth. This will involve making hard political decisions, said George Magnus, an independent economist and associate at the China Centre at Oxford University.For instance, it should consider national legislation to raise retirement ages, Mr Magnus said. The current retirement age for most men in China is 60, while the OECD average is 64.2. The number stands at 55 for female civil servants and 50 for female blue-collar workers.However, previous calls to raise the retirement age have sparked backlash in China, with older workers not wanting to delay access to their pensions. China is already pursuing automation through robotics and artificial intelligence, but the impact on productivity is still unclear, Mr Harris said.Another solution would be to bolster the population through immigration, although this is not an option that the Chinese Communist Party has favoured historically, he noted.Although China can no longer rely on its demographic dividend to fuel its economy, that may not be a bad thing if it manages to seek growth from other sources such as productivity, some observers say.\"We should be much more nuanced about the stall in China's population growth. Planetary sustainability and urban congestion are better served by a more stable world population, which may entail declines in some countries,\" Mr Magnus said.\"Demography is not destiny. The key is to get these and other nations to focus like a laser beam on 'coping mechanisms'.\"Watch: The past, present and future of global population explained - by the BBC's Stephanie Hegarty","Date":"2023-01-20 00:53:00.000Z","Url":"/news/world-asia-china-64329890","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2994/production/_128344601_e59b7eebd77ebc87ab54d5adff300460a27ae2040_0_6960_46401000x667.jpg"},{"Topic":"Asia","Title":"Why Shah Rukh Khan's comeback film is a big deal","Article":"Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's latest film Pathaan, which releases next week, has been hitting the headlines in India for the past several weeks. The interest is hardly surprising - Khan is among India's biggest and most-loved stars. Charming, funny and with millions of fans at home and abroad, the actor is often described as Bollywood's \"most important cultural export\", whose popularity travels beyond his films. His fans endearingly refer to him as King Khan or the King of Bollywood. And Pathaan is his first film after a four-year hiatus. The 57-year-old is making a comeback on the big screen after a series of setbacks in his personal and professional life, including the arrest of his son Aryan Khan last year on fake charges of drug possession - the charges were eventually dropped - and a number of films that didn't do well. The gap has piqued interest in Khan and also led to a heightened scrutiny of the film, which also stars Deepika Padukone, one of India's most popular stars, and John Abraham.Starting in December when the filmmakers began releasing promotional videos of Pathaan's songs, the film has been the subject of incessant chatter on social media.And since its trailer dropped last week, the fan frenzy has peaked. It has been watched more than 49 million times on YouTube. Khan's tweet of the Hindi trailer has had 3.9 million views and an additional half a million each for the Telugu and Tamil versions.Reports say there has been \"exceptional response\" to advanced ticket sales in the US, UAE, Germany and Australia.The plot, described by fans as a crossover between James Bond and Mission Impossible films, is rather predictable. A terrorist group is seeking to destroy India with \"an attack they could not have imagined\". The authorities scramble to fight them, but time is running out. At stake is the country's future. So, they put their best man to work. \"If you dare to party at Pathaan's house, then I will have to come to greet you - with fireworks,\" an unmistakable voice sneers at us, as Khan makes an appearance.  A suave spy with tousled hair and chiselled biceps and abs, Khan effortlessly takes down enemies, hops on moving vehicles, rappels down skyscrapers and seduces women while trying to save his nation from evil forces, led by Abraham. A pulsing music track accompanies the shots. The two-and-half-minute trailer has excited fans and critics alike, who've been gushing over the scale of the project. A fan called it a \"paisa vasool [value for money] experience\", adding that he would try to catch the film as soon as it released. But right from the start, Pathaan has been mired in controversies. Khan has had a fair share of troubles with the press and critics in the past. But ever since his comments about growing religious intolerance in India a few years back, the barrage of attacks from Hindu right-wing groups have become more personal and concerted.\"It has acquired a distinctly communal twinge, as they seek to anchor the actor's image around his religious identity,\" says author and film critic Saibal Chatterjee.Until a few years back, he says, Bollywood was seen as a place that existed beyond religious and political differences and \"entertainment was the only thing that mattered\". But, he adds, the industry has now become increasingly polarised. \"Khan is one of the remaining few actors who represents that past which some sections want to be obliterated completely. That's why they cannot stand him.\"Already riled by the film's name Pathaan - a Muslim title - the hardline Hindu groups raked up a controversy over one of its songs after Padukone was seen in a saffron-coloured bikini in the song Besharam Rang - which translates from Hindi to shameless colour.They accused Khan of insulting Hindus as saffron is a colour associated with their religion, even though Padukone changes costumes several times during the song. There have been calls to ban the film unless the song is removed, protesters have torn up posters and burnt Khan's effigies, a petition has been filed in a court accusing the cast of hurting the sentiments of the Hindu community and the film has been accused of promoting nudity and obscenity.There have been sustained calls to boycott Pathaan and abusive hashtags have trended on social media. But as the countdown to Pathaan's release begins, Khan and the filmmakers have skirted around the controversies, instead concentrating on the film's promotion.  During the Fifa World Cup, footballer Wayne Rooney appeared along with the actor in a short promotional video, repeating after Khan in Hindi - \"Apni kursi ki peti bandh lo, Mausam bigadne wala hai [Fasten your seatbelts, the weather is about to get turbulent]\".And earlier this week, Khan visited Dubai where a large crowd of cheering fans watched Pathaan's trailer, projected on the façade of Burj Khalifa. From the actor's reputation to the film's 2.5bn rupee ($30m; £25m)-budget, a lot is at stake and some have wondered if the negative publicity could impact the film's success. It's an assessment Chatterjee disagrees with.\"Khan is not just an actor, he is a brand, probably the biggest we've had in the country, and most certainly in Bollywood,\" he says.Shrayana Bhattacharya, author of a book called Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh Khan, says the star's fans will \"never reduce him to religion or political calculations\". \"They will watch Pathaan first day first show because they have missed him on screen,\" she adds.But some are wondering if the spy-thriller genre is the right kind for Khan's return to the big screen after a four-year gap?Khan made his name playing a romantic hero, an actor who defined love - its language, fickleness and the anxieties that come with it - for an entire generation. And women, who make up a large part of his fan base, may not be interest in seeing him as an action hero. A few days back, the actor said he always wanted to be an action hero and that's why Pathaan \"is a dream come true for me\". Chatterjee says he has \"some reservations\" about the movie, but it is \"a daring idea\".Over the years, he points out, the actor has experimented with scripts, playing different types of roles, such as the ones in My Name is Khan, Chak de India and Love You Zindagi. With Pathaan, he says, Khan is clearly \"breaking the mould\". \"But at this point in his career, he can afford to do that. He is fearless and he is experimenting. He has nothing to lose.\"And whether the gamble pays off or not, one thing is certain: \"You don't miss a Shah Rukh Khan film,\" he says.","Date":"2023-01-20 00:13:00.000Z","Url":"/news/world-asia-india-64245736","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9CB5/production/_128271104_pathaancleanposter.jpg"},{"Topic":"UK","Title":"Superhighway of hedgerows set to protect wildlife","Article":"A wildlife superhighway of hedgerows in a national park is designed to protect different plant and animal species.

The body of Steven Davies, who was 39, was found at his home in June 2022, after he had been stabbed. His partner Carrie McGuinness, 35, of Rhydyfelin, Rhondda Cynon Taf, admitted manslaughter by way of diminished responsibility due to \"alcohol dependence syndrome\".At Cardiff Crown Court, she was jailed for 15 years and six months.The court heard Mr Davies suffered a one inch (2.5cm) stab wound that pierced his colon and led to infection.Days before his body was found, a neighbour heard shouting and McGuinness saying: \"This is my flat, get out.\"Later that day, another neighbour spoke to McGuinness, who said Mr Davies had beaten her up and that she had \"just stabbed him\". After he had not been in contact for a number of days, a friend visited his home in Glyncoch, Pontypridd, on 15 June 2022. Prosecutor Jonathan Rees said: \"He looked through the window and saw his friend naked and face down on his bed.\"Mr Davies' blood was found on an armchair, a pillow and a towel. Used bandages with his blood were found in a bin bag and on the bathroom floor, and female jogging trousers with the blood of both Mr Davies and McGuinness were in a bag.Mr Davies also suffered from alcohol dependency, and had previously self harmed. However, medical professionals deemed that the stab wound was \"not characteristic of self harm\", the court heard.McGuinness was arrested and told police Mr Davies had stayed with her between 2 and 10 June, in which time he had been violent and injured her nose.She suggested they take a relationship break and he then left which was the last time she heard from him, the defendant said. The pair had a history of domestic violence, and were both breaking their bail conditions in assault cases against one another by being together. \"It was clear that the relationship was turbulent and volatile, but they were seen in early June, drinking together in the garden, seemingly in a good mood,\" Mr Rees added.McGuinness claimed she did not know about Mr Davies' injury, or how it could have happened, but alcohol affected her memory. Data from the victim's phone and a tablet computer showed searches for phrases including \"vomit\", \"blood\" and \"end of life\". McGuiness had previous convictions for assault of a former partner. However, defence barrister Nicholas Rhodes said she was not dangerous \"to the general public\".She was a trained teacher and a mother-of-two, who had lost custody of her children due to depression and anxiety. In sentencing her, Justice Timothy Kerr said the relationship was \"unstable\". \"You must have known that you and Mr Davies were clearly a danger to each other. That's what the bail conditions were for,\" he said.However, he conceded that the killing was not deliberate or planned, and that Mr Davies had also shown violence towards her. \"You are prone to reckless behaviour,\" he said. In a statement read in court, Mr Davies' mother, Donna, said: \"I miss my son every day. \"I often wake up hoping this has all been a nightmare and Steven is still here and is going to show up at my door with his cheeky smile. \"Steven was my child and my world.

We've tried to explore all those avenues.\"However, he said this report \"puts the pyridine story to bed\".MPs probing the crustacean deaths previously criticised the government-commissioned investigation for a \"lack of transparency\".The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee had expressed concerns over a lack of transparency and communication about the report, including - at the time - revealing which experts were chosen to make up the panel. The report said pathogens known to cause similar symptoms had caused crustaceans to die around the world.It said no significant pathogens were identified in the North East case but \"full molecular screening was not conducted at the time of the initial investigation\".Defra chief scientific adviser Gideon Henderson said the report - by \"leading marine scientists\" - was \"unable to identify a single clear cause\" but had pointed to those more likely to explain the outbreak.Simon Clarke, Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland's Conservative MP, said it was now \"definitively clear\" the deaths were not caused by \"either capital or maintenance dredging of the Tees or anything else associated with the Teesworks site\". He said it was a \"concern\" investigators had suggested an unknown pathogen was to blame, adding: \"There is now more to be done to investigate this and also to look at the support that we can offer our local fishermen to recover.\"Fishermen, including Adrian Noble in Whitby, had described the situation with the die-offs as \"horrendous\".Redcar Conservative MP Jacob Young said that after the \"apocalyptic scenes\" seen on the beaches, \"our focus should now turn to how we help support our fisherman rebuild the industry on Teesside\". Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said the report \"made it clear\" neither dredging nor work for the freeport had played a part in the die-off.\"When I was elected, I promised former steelworkers who worked on that site that I would create a new thriving industry of the future with thousands of good-quality local jobs for local people,\" he said.\"Today, backed by the science, we can look every single one of them in the eye and say the work we are doing, in an area that means so much to so many people, is safe and is of the highest possible standard.\"He said the deaths had been \"devastating\" for the fishing community and it was essential the government supported fishermen and helped them recover.However, Stockton North's Labour MP Alex Cunningham said he considered the matter \"very much not closed\", calling for further investigations and Andy McDonald, Middlesbrough's Labour MP, said the report \"resolves nothing\".Follow BBC North East \u0026 Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Humza Yousaf told MSPs on Thursday it would give \"consideration\" to a potential ban of the devices. Later the Scottish government said it could also consider increasing access to disposal options, improved product design or publicity campaigns. In October, the Irish government launched a consultation on banning \"wasteful\" disposable vape products, citing concerns over littering.Disposable vapes, which typically cost a few pounds, are marketed as \"beginner friendly\" and can last for the equivalent of a pack of 20 cigarettes - around 600 \"puffs\". The single-use vapes are designed to feel more like a cigarette than larger reusable devices, but some manufacturers are now producing refillable and rechargeable pods with a similar slim case.Because they contain valuable materials such as lithium batteries and copper, as well as plastic, vapes are classed as Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and users are supposed to dispose of them at a household recycling centre or at the shop where they bought the device. Currently large shops must take back all items of small electronic products like disposable vapes in store to be recycled for free, regardless of whether the item was bought in that shop.And smaller retailers are legally obliged to finance the take back, collection and treatment of these products when they become waste.Green MSP Gillian Mackay raised the issue at Holyrood, citing a newspaper's campaign against disposable vapes.She said: \"As well as being an issue for public health, they are an issue for the environment...Would the cabinet secretary support a ban on single-use vapes?\"Mr Yousaf said Public Health Scotland was examining the impact of vaping, with an action plan due in the autumn.While the World Health Organisation said they were \"undoubtedly harmful to health\", there was limited evidence on their long-term impact, he said.He congratulated Dundee-based campaigner Laura Young for highlighting the issue, saying she was \"colloquially described as the vape crusader\".The PHD student and climate activist collects discarded vapes littered in the streets, recently picking up about one device per minute in an hour-long walk near her home. Mr Yousaf said: \"She has done an incredible job going around the country picking up these vapes that are undoubtedly causing environmental harm.\" He added: \"We will ask stakeholders with the relevant expertise to examine the evidence and assess what action the Scottish government and other partners should take.\"That will include consideration of a potential ban.\" Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: \"Any form of littering is an unacceptable, anti-social behaviour, that is damaging to the environment and the economy. \"Single-use items, like disposable vapes, are becoming an all-too-common eyesore in areas where we live, work, and socialise, and can last in our environment for years and years. \"Tackling our throwaway culture is a priority here at Zero Waste Scotland and we are happy to lead on this important review.\"","Date":"2023-01-20 14:28:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-scotland-64336216","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9BD6/production/_127249893_whatsappimage2022-10-18at4.12.17pm.jpg"},{"Topic":"UK","Title":"Family's lives 'destroyed by death of patient'","Article":"The family of a patient who died after treatment at Wales' biggest hospital say their lives have been \"destroyed\".The man died days after emergency surgery at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) in Cardiff, for an obstructed hernia. A report by public services ombudsman Michelle Morris said the care he received amounted to a \"significant service failure\". Cardiff and Vale University Health Board \"apologised unreservedly\". The ombudsman wrote: \"I have no doubt that the findings of this report will be a source of great distress to her and her family\".The patient - whose identity has not been made public - went to the hospital's Emergency Department with symptoms of obstructed hernia and bowel obstruction. He was discharged after being assessed. Two days later, he was admitted to the hospital but died a few days after he had emergency surgery. The ombudsman launched an investigation after the patient's daughter complained about the care he received. In the complaint, the daughter said the family's lives were destroyed by the patient's death and that they still had no answers.The ombudsman report found that when the patient was first admitted, the health board failed to adequately assess his clinical history and new symptoms, which suggested that he had acute obstructed hernia.It also revealed that when the patient was admitted to hospital two days later, his condition was not promptly diagnosed which led to a delay in him getting emergency surgery.Following the surgery, the patient was not moved to the Intensive Care Unit despite being very unwell. The report found that had these failings not occurred, the outcome may have been different.The patient was admitted to hospital at the beginning of the Covid pandemic and the report took the impact of this on the health board into account. However, the ombudsman concluded that the care that the patient received amounted to a \"significant service failure\".Suzanne Rankin, chief executive of Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: \"I would like to apologise unreservedly for the failings in the care of [the patient] and the distress this has caused for his family. \"We are implementing the recommendations from the ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the implementation of all recommendations within the timescale.\"We would welcome the opportunity to meet with the family... to discuss the report and recommendations in more detail.\"","Date":"2023-01-20 14:05:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-wales-64345593","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1229B/production/_107659347_uhw97621.jpg"},{"Topic":"UK","Title":"King visits world's biggest Corn Flakes factory","Article":"King Charles has visited the world's biggest Corn Flakes factory.His trip to the Kellogg's plant in Trafford Park, Manchester, was intended to mark the centenary of the US company introducing its cereals to the UK in 1922.King Charles, who unveiled a plaque, sparked laughter when he joked: \"Sorry, I'm a year late.\"The monarch also visited the offices of the UK's intelligence, security and cyber agency GCHQ.He met staff and schoolchildren learning codebreaking skills at the hub, which opened in the city centre in 2019.Kellogg's has been a holder of the Royal Warrant - which enables a firm to trade with the Royal Household and use the Royal Arms - since the reign of the King's grandfather George VI.In the 1980s, its cereals were delivered to Buckingham Palace in a small van named Genevieve.

The club has now improved safety measures. The report revealed that the pilot was taking part in a practice exercise simulating a failed winch launch. Pilots were required to take a flight check as part of the club's return to normal flying at Usk Airfield in Monmouthshire after the Covid-19 shutdown.The instructor told investigators he thought the pilot would land the glider on the runway as there was still enough space left, and was surprised when the pilot turned away from the airfield.The pilot said he didn't think there was enough space to land straight ahead and instead tried to manoeuvre to a field near the runway.Witnesses said the glider was too low to complete the turn and hit a tree before striking the ground.Both occupants suffered neck and back injuries in the crash and the glider was written off.Following the crash, the gliding club has introduced a series of new safety actions including:","Date":"2023-01-20 12:48:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-wales-64345589","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/142AE/production/_128360628_crashphotopea2.jpg"},{"Topic":"UK","Title":"Man denies murder of Shane Whitla in Lurgan","Article":"A 25-year-old man has appeared in court charged with the murder of Shane Whitla in Lurgan, County Armagh.Mr Whitla, 39, was shot in an alleyway near his home on 12 January before making his way to Lord Lurgan Park, where he collapsed.Police have said he was shot a number of times, including once in the back.Kevin Conway, 25, from Deeny Drive in Lurgan, appeared before Craigavon Magistrates' Court on Friday.

The train drivers' union, Aslef, has called strikes on 1 and 3 February.Its action will affect passengers across 15 rail companies:On the same days, the few hundred train drivers who are members of the RMT union will also strike. This will also affect C2C and Island Line services.Strikes by other rail workers represented by the RMT have previously had a major impact on services throughout England, Scotland and Wales.Although no further dates have been confirmed, the union said it had a mandate to take action up until May, and could \"go further\".The unions are in dispute with the government and rail companies about pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions.Unions say any pay offer should reflect the rising cost of living. - currently above 10%.But the rail industry is under pressure to save money, after the pandemic left a hole in its finances. Bosses say reforms need to be agreed, to afford pay increases and modernise the railway.Network Rail is planning to cut 1,900 jobs as part of changes to the way its maintenance teams work - although it insists most of this could be achieved by people leaving voluntarily.The RMT disagrees with some of the changes and wants a guarantee of no compulsory job losses.The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train companies, made an offer which would have seen train drivers get a backdated pay rise of 4% for 2022 and a 4% increase this year.Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said the proposal was unacceptable \"but we are willing to engage in further discussions\".Separately, Network Rail made an offer to other rail workers of a 5% pay rise in 2022 and a 4% pay rise in 2023.But RMT union boss Mick Lynch described the deal as \"substandard\" and its members have rejected itThe RMT also rejected an offer from the RDG that included a pay increase of up to 8% over two years and a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies until April 2024.On 20 January the RDG offered the RMT a 9% rise over two years for crew and station staff.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has estimated the average salary of rail workers in 2022 was £45,919, based on five different job categories. If drivers are excluded, its estimate is £39,518. The RMT said that figure was still too high because it excluded rail cleaning staff who are not categorised as rail workers by the ONS. The RDG said the offer which Aslef rejected would have seen the average salary for a driver increase from £60,000 per year to £65,000 by the end of 2023.

I feel forced out of it\"A 73-year-old man has to travel 100 miles each time he goes to the dentist due to a lack of practices taking NHS patients. Dafydd Williams has lived in Newtown, Powys, for 20 years but his dentist is in Telford, Shropshire.Powys was one of 10 councils the BBC found last year did not have any dentists taking new adult NHS patients.The Welsh government said it is providing an additional £2m annually to improve access to dental services.It said the changes it has introduced to dental contracts aim to secure 112,000 appointments for new patients this year. However, the British Dental Association (BDA) criticised that claim, accusing the Welsh government of \"cooking the books\" and \"making misleading claims\".\"I'm angry to be honest that we have to travel so many miles to see a dentist,\" said Mr Williams.\"We go twice a year for a check-up, but of course if we need to have any treatment and they say we have to go back in 10 days or a fortnight - that's another day gone.\"According to the BDA, new NHS contracts issued by the Welsh government put an emphasis on seeing new patients, but it claims this is at a detriment to those already registered at practices. The BDA claims that for every new NHS patient taken on, \"a dozen historic patients could lose access to dentistry\".Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Andrew Dickenson, the chief dental officer for Wales, said dentistry has had \"some very unique challenges\" over the past few years. \"At present services are being recovered, but that takes time and I can fully appreciate the sentiments coming from Dr Roberts and Mr Williams but what we've been trying to do is address the unmet need for the population.\"Mr Dickenson said practices have been asked if they would offer appointments to patients who have not had regular dental treatment to address the problems to give more \"stability\" to services. Dentist and BDA representative Tristan Roberts has worked for the NHS since graduating, but said he now feels he is being \"forced out of it\".\"I think it [NHS dentistry] is on a precipice at the moment and is hanging by a thread,\" he told Newyddion S4C.\"I think we're losing what dentistry is about these days. It's all about funding and cutting costs.\"The BBC has learned of several dental practices in different parts of the country that have brought NHS dentist services to an end, turning to private healthcare only.This week, a letter was sent to patients of the Marquess Dental surgery in Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, Anglesey, stating that it was \"impossible\" to continue providing the \"standard of care they wish\" to NHS patients so it would be only offering private dental care from the beginning of April.Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds, who represents Mid and West Wales in the Senedd, said she had discovered that in November last year, there were 794 children under 18 on a waiting list for an NHS dentist in Powys alone.She said: \"There's a two-tier system here in Wales where, if you have the money, you can pay and you can afford it. \"But if you don't, then you either just have to wait until an appointment becomes available or you have nowhere to go to register locally.\"In the Senedd on Tuesday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said 1,100 additional dental appointments have been made for children in Powys in the past eight months.The Welsh government said: \"Changes to the NHS dentistry contract, offered to dental practices since last April 2022, also includes a requirement to see new patients. \"This means an estimated 112,000 new NHS patient appointments will be possible in Wales this year.\"","Date":"2023-01-20 12:38:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-wales-64331126","ImgUrl":""},{"Topic":"UK","Title":"Your pictures of Scotland","Article":"A selection of your pictures of Scotland sent in between 13 and 20 January.Send your photos to scotlandpictures@bbc.co.uk.

Her mother, 28 year-old Aleksandra Wahab, and the child's stepfather, 34-year-old Abdul Wahab, went on trial on Wednesday at Belfast Crown Court, accused of murder. When the case resumed on Thursday, Abdul Wahab pleaded guilty to murder.The Pakistani national also pleaded guilty to two charges of grievous bodily harm with intent 24 hours before the child's death and on other occasions between July and December that year. The judge, Mr Justice O'Hara, sentenced Wahab to life imprisonment. A minimum period, before he can be released, will be set at a future date.The trial had been told the schoolgirl was tortured and killed in her home - a place where she should have felt safe.During the opening, Crown barrister Liam McCollum detailed the injuries inflicted on Nadia.As well as suffering a skull fracture and lacerated liver which caused her death, Nadia had sustained fractures and re-fractures to her ribs, a fractured collarbone, a fractured pelvis and an injury to her bowel.Also present at Nadia's time of death were 70 surface injuries including bruising and abrasions.This led the Crown to conclude that Nadia had been subjected to a campaign of physical abuse in the family home which culminated in her death. As the hearing was due to resume on Thursday, barristers for both Mr and Mrs Wahab asked that their clients be re-arraigned. At this point Abdul Wahab bowed his head and tearfully pleaded guilty to the murder.Aleksandra Wahab pleaded guilty to allowing the death of a child and allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm. These pleas were accepted by the court and the jury was discharged.She was remanded back into custody. Addressing the jury of seven men and five woman, the judge said that as both defendants had now pleaded guilty to three charges each, he directed them to return not guilty verdicts on all the remaining counts.Nadia was a P1 student at St James's Primary School, Newtownabbey.

Retail sales had been expected to rise last month in what is a key season for shops because of Christmas.However, the volume of goods people bought in December fell by 1% from November, and by a record 5.8% compared with December 2021.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also confirmed retail sales for last year recorded the worst-ever fall. They fell by 3% between 2021 and 2022, which is the biggest decline since ONS records began in 1997.Prices have been rising sharply since last year, mainly due to soaring energy costs, which has put pressure on millions of households.While the rate of inflation is starting to ease, at 10.5% it remains close to a 40-year high.The ONS said retailers had indicated that \"consumers are cutting back on spending because of increased prices and affordability concerns\".While the amount of goods and food bought fell in December, rising prices mean a large number of retailers have reported strong sales figures based on value over the Christmas period.\"It's worth noting that sales growth has been driven by customers spending more due to inflation rather than buying more,\" said Silvia Rindone, UK and Ireland retail strategy leader at accountancy firm EY.John Adams, managing director at Jarrold, a department store in Norwich, said that Christmas sales had risen by 13%. However, it appeared people were spending more on fewer items.\"I think from our perspective they were probably being more considered about what they were buying so we saw the average unit transaction actually increase,\" he said. \"People tended to be buying quality and investing in things rather than buying perhaps frivolous things.\"There was a sharp drop in volume at non-food stores, but food stores also reported a fall in sales in December, according to the ONS.It said the drop in food sales during December reinforced the view that people stocked up for Christmas earlier. In November, the volume of retail sales at food stores rose by 1%.\"After last month's boost as shoppers stocked up early, food sales fell back again in December with supermarkets reporting this was due to increased food prices and the rising cost of living,\" said Heather Bovill, deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the ONS.Bill Grimsey, the former boss of Iceland and Wickes, told the BBC's Today programme: \"Christmas is the key trading time for retailers to often make a difference between profit and loss, particularly in the food sector where volumes are so very important.\"Online sales also fell between November and December. The proportion of online sales dipped to 25.4% from 25.9% in the previous month.Ms Bovill said feedback from retailers indicated \"postal strikes were leading people towards purchasing more goods instore\". Mr Adams said: \"Our footfall was ahead of 2019, so ahead of pandemic levels. I think particularly in the run-up to Christmas people were worried about delivery disruption with the strikes that were happening so there was definitely a swing back to in-store experience.\" Looking ahead, John Allan, chairman of the UK's biggest supermarket chain Tesco, said that while there is a hope inflation will drop sharply in the middle of the year, \"that doesn't mean prices are going to fall\".He said: \"I think it means the increase in prices, we hope, will be much less sharp in the second half of this year and it is probably going to be into 2024 and beyond before we see the normal level of inflation we've enjoyed in previous years.\"Mr Allan called on the government to provide a detailed plan to help boost economic growth.\"What we'd love to see from government is a really serious, thought-through, long-term growth plan,\" he said. \"Long-term growth is the only way in which we're actually going to be able to raise standards of living for our fellow citizens.\"We've had a host of big retailers reporting better-than-expected Christmas trading but these ONS figures are a bit of a reality check on what's really going on.We've been spending more but getting less for our money. And that's the overall story of retail in 2022 as inflation has taken a huge bite out of our spending power. This year's festive figures are also flattered by easier comparatives from the previous year which was disrupted by the Omicron variant of Covid and supply chain problems leading to less available stock. There had been fears that retail would be a wipe-out this Christmas. Consumers did still spend but this all-important season didn't deliver much festive cheer. And it seems inevitable spending will be reined back in the first half of this year with higher bills coming down the tracks including all those purchases put on credit cards. The ONS also revised down figures for November. It said that sales volumes fell by 0.5% instead of the original estimate of a 0.4% drop.Capital Economics said the figures for December showed a \"disappointing end to a difficult year\".\"Today's retail sales release suggests that some of the resilience in the economy towards the end of last year appeared to peter out in December,\" said Olivia Cross, an economist at Capital Economics.","Date":"2023-01-20 11:40:00.000Z","Url":"/news/business-64334048","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B01C/production/_128348054_capture.jpg"},{"Topic":"UK","Title":"Four more days of ambulance strikes in Wales","Article":"Four more days of strikes by ambulance workers in Wales have been announced by the Unite union. The dates in February and March coincide with walkouts by GMB union ambulance staff in a pay dispute.On 6 February GMB nurses will join the ambulance strikers in the biggest NHS walkout in this dispute.A health department spokesman said it is \"continuing to have constructive discussions\" with unions about pay.Both Unite and GMB members will be striking on 6 February, 20 February, 6 March and 20 March. These are in addition to the two Unite strikes taking place in January.The announcement came as part of 10 fresh strike dates throughout January, February and March across Wales, England and Northern Ireland. Not all union member ambulance staff - including paramedics, call handlers and support workers - will strike at once. Under trade union law emergency cover will still be provided and staff can leave the picket lines to attend.Ahead of previous strikes in January and December, patients were told that all Category 1 calls - classed as the most life-threatening situations, such as cardiac arrest - would be responded to by an ambulance. However, less urgent calls which are not immediately judged to be life-threatening (Category 2), might have to wait longer than usual for an ambulance but they would still respond to strokes and heart attacks. Urgent problems that fit into Category 3 - such as a woman in late-stage labour - would not be prioritised, the public was told.Unite is also a smaller union, meaning on some days only a couple of hundred ambulance workers across the country will actually be striking across the 10 ambulance services in England, those in Wales and Northern Ireland.Speaking to the BBC in the Political Thinking podcast, Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said staff were \"fighting for the NHS\".Ms Graham said: \"People are dying as we speak because of waiting times and the clogging up of the NHS.\"In all cases, patients with the most urgent clinical need will be given priority.\"The dispute centres on pay, with workers calling for above-inflation (10.5% in the year to December) pay rises.The government has made it clear it is not willing to move on this year's pay award.But the governments in England and Wales have given NHS staff an average of 4.75%, with everyone guaranteed at least £1,400 - as recommended by the independent NHS Pay Review Body.That is less than half the rate of inflation, although latest figures show the rate at which prices are rising has started to slow.One option being explored by Health Secretary Steve Barclay is backdating the 2023-24 rise to January. It would normally kick in in April.The Treasury has not agreed to the idea.This has already been tabled in Scotland, leading to NHS strikes being halted for further negotiations - although staff there received a 7.5% pay rise this year.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"It is disappointing some union members are going ahead with further strikes at a time when the NHS is already under huge pressure from Covid, flu and tackling the backlog.\"The Health and Social Care Secretary is continuing to have constructive discussions with unions about the 2023/24 pay review process and what is affordable and fair.\"","Date":"2023-01-20 11:11:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-wales-64343606","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/129FD/production/_128358267_gettyimages-1451100802.jpg"},{"Topic":"UK","Title":"Ex-Army head questions 'Hooded Men' torture claims","Article":"A former professional head of the Army has questioned whether the treatment of 14 men interned during the Troubles amounted to torture. The men, known as the Hooded Men, were interned without trial in 1971.Gen Sir Mike Jackson made the remarks in a BBC documentary detailing the men's experience.In 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the methods used \"would be characterised today\" as torture.During their Army detention, the men said they were forced to listen to constant loud static noise, deprived of sleep, food and water, forced to stand in a stress position and beaten if they fell.They also said they were hooded and thrown from helicopters a short distance off the ground, having been told they were hundreds of feet in the air.Sir Mike, who was a captain with 1 Para from 1970 to 1973, said: \"As to whether or not, in extremis, physical violence on a prisoner of war or a detainee is ever acceptable is a very important question.\"Torture is illegal. [There is] a very clear convention on the matter.\"Whether depriving somebody of sleep for two nights, should or should not be illegal, I'm a bit more uncertain.\"Sir Mike claimed he was not in a position to argue with the \"perception\" of the 14 men and how they felt about their treatment. He said: \"This question, can non-violent ill-treatment equal torture, is very philosophical as well as legal.\"\"You might be better asking a bishop on such matters.\"In 1976 the European Commission of Human Rights ruled that the five techniques used on the men amounted to torture.This ruling was later referred to the European Court of Human Rights in 1978, which held that the UK had carried out inhuman and degrading treatment, but fell short of defining it as torture.In 2019, Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, Northern Ireland's most senior judge, said their treatment \"would, if it occurred today, properly be characterised as torture\".Jim Auld was taken away by soldiers as he returned to his home in west Belfast, before being transferred to an interrogation centre in County Londonderry by helicopter.\"After it crossed north Belfast, for me it might as well have been Outer Mongolia, it was that far away from where my normal haunts were,\" he said.\"They brought me into a compound and there were two lines of soldiers, about 30 of them, about 15 on each side and there were two or three dogs at the beginning of it barking.\"They were all standing with lumps of wood and baseball bats and that sort of thing and they pushed me in there and each of them, as I was running by, battered me.\"When I fell, the guy at the back was keeping the dog off me, but letting the dog get close to me so I had to hurry up and get up.\"As I got up I had to go through that until the end and they were all laughing and joking and swearing and cursing at me.\"Raymond White, who headed the Royal Ulster Constabulary's special branch, told the BBC the treatment the Hooded Men underwent \"came very close to the border line\" between \"dehumanising treatment\" and torture. \"Torture to me, in a sense, was what the like of the Nazis were doing with the French resistance and people like that. There was gross physical violence, people were actually beaten to death,\" he said\"I wouldn't, I don't think, in the round accept that it actually was torture as I would have described it at the time or since.\"However, he said it would be \"right and proper\" for the government and Police Service of Northern Ireland to apologise to the men if they accept the Supreme Court ruling that the techniques used amounted to torture.

The unprecedented joint letter has been sent to the Northern Ireland secretary and the head of the civil service.On Tuesday, the Education Authority (EA) said it could not make £110m in savings this year.In the said under-investment in schools would affect \"every child and young person\".The letter to Chris Heaton-Harris and Jayne Brady has been signed by the chief executive of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) Gerry Campbell and Controlled Schools Support Council (CSSC) Mark Baker. The chief executive of the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, Roisin Marshall, has also signed, as has the head of the Irish-medium body Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta Maria Thomasson, and the Catholic Schools' Trustee Service Fintan Murphy.Nuala O'Neill, the chief executive of the Governing Bodies Association, which represents many grammars, and Dr Andrew Brown, the chair of the Transferor Representatives' Council - which represents the three main Protestant churches - complete the signatories.In the letter they said they \"would be failing the children and young people of Northern Ireland if we did not share our significant concerns about the impact of the current crisis in education funding.\"\"Without question, reduction in funding and ongoing under investment will negatively impact the quality of education of every child and young person living in NI,\" they continued.The letter also said that less was spent on each child's education in Northern Ireland than in England, Scotland or Wales.According to previous analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), Northern Ireland spends less on each school pupil's education than any other part of the UK.\"Why is the education of a young person in NI valued less than those in England, Scotland and Wales?\" the letter asked.They also said Chancellor Jeremy Hunt had provided £2.3bn of additional funding for schools in England in his autumn statement in November 2022.\"Why is there such a lack of equality between the important funding commitments given to English pupils and our children and young people?\" the leaders' letter asked.Their letter concluded by calling for \"an urgent meeting involving everyone with a concern for the future of our children and young people\".\"The focus must be on the restoration of education funding to levels that can fully support the needs of schools and ensure children have the best start in life,\" it said.\"Failure to address this problem will have a negative impact for many generations to come.\"At almost £2.5bn, the education budget is Stormont's second largest behind health. In his November 2022 budget, Mr Heaton-Harris provided education will a cash increase of £286m compared to the baseline in 2021-22.But he also warned that the Department of Education (DE) would need to take action to live within its budget, and to make significant cuts to its \"current spending trajectory\".The EA subsequently said it could not deliver around £110m of savings it was required to make by the end of March.The authority expects more than half of over 1000 schools in Northern Ireland to be in the red by March 2023 and is warning of a school maintenance backlog of £500m.The warning comes as a former head of Northern Ireland's civil service said Stormont's Executive departments could be facing about £1bn of pressures and cuts in the next financial year. Speaking on BBC's The View programme, Sir David Sterling said senior civil servants who had been left to manage public services had been put in an uncertain position in the absence of a functioning executive. Sir David also suggested that there could be double digit increases in the regional rate.  \"My understanding is that the [Northern Ireland] secretary of state has given a commitment to produce a budget before the start of the financial year in April - one of the things he will have to do is decide how much to increase the regional rate,\" he said.\"I am reminded that in 2005 Peter Hain, who was secretary of state during that period of direct rule, increased the regional rate by 19%.\"That was, in a sense, almost saying: 'If the people of NI aren't going to govern themselves I am going to take some tough decisions,' and I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't see something similar again.\"","Date":"2023-01-20 09:11:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-northern-ireland-64339201","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15E37/production/_128355698_school.jpg"},{"Topic":"UK","Title":"Record flu rates and teachers persevere for deal","Article":"","Date":"2023-01-20 08:35:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-scotland-64337977","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png"},{"Topic":"England","Title":"Woman sets new record for solo polar expedition","Article":"A British Army officer has broken the world record for the longest solo and unsupported polar expedition by a woman.Preet Chandi, known as Polar Preet, first made history trekking to the South Pole in 2021.The 33-year-old has so far travelled 868 miles (1,397 km) across Antarctica in temperatures as cold as -50C (-58F).The previous female record was 858 miles (1,381 km), skied by Anja Blacha in 2020. However, Capt Chandi, from Sinfin in Derby, did not complete her original aim of becoming the first woman to cross Antarctica solo and unsupported. She set off from Hercules Inlet in November and hoped to reach Reedy Glacier within 75 days.An online blog, which she has kept along the way, was last updated on Thursday.She reported being about 30 nautical miles away from her pick-up point and \"pretty gutted\" to have missed out on the crossing record.Despite extreme cold and high winds, she said her spirits were being kept up by listening to recorded messages from friends and family.Capt Chandi, who is a physiotherapist working at a regional rehabilitation unit in Buckinghamshire, said: \"I'm pretty gutted that I don't have the time to complete the crossing.\"I know that I have done a huge journey, it's just difficult while I'm on the ice and I know it's not that far away.\"She has been congratulated by the University of Derby, who awarded her an honorary degree last year.Prof Kathryn Mitchell, vice-chancellor of the university, said: \"We are delighted to hear about Captain Chandi's record-breaking achievement. \"It was a privilege to award her an honorary degree at the University of Derby last year; she is an inspirational role model for our students, demonstrating how determination and commitment reap rewards.\"Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Manchester Crown Court heard the girl, referred to as Child H, suffered two \"profound\" collapses at the Countess of Chester Hospital in September 2015.The prosecution allege Ms Letby, 32, was responsible for the incidents.Ms Letby denies murdering seven babies and attempting to murder 10 others between 2015 and 2016.Jurors heard Child H, who was born six weeks premature, needed treatment for a pneumothorax, which occurs when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall.On the evening of 24 September 2015, Dr Alison Ventress performed a procedure called a thoracocentesis, which involves inserting a needle into the chest to withdraw air, on Child H. The registrar then inserted a pigtail chest drain to prevent any accumulation of air within the chest. However, in the early hours of 25 September more air had accumulated and Dr Ventress sought assistance from consultant paediatrician Dr Ravi Jayaram. Dr Jayaram arrived on the neonatal unit shortly before 02:00 BST and took the decision to insert a second drain.Citing an X-ray of Child H's chest, Ms Letby's defence counsel Ben Myers KC put it to Dr Jayaram that he inserted the drain in the \"wrong place\".Mr Myers told the court according to medical best practice, a drain should be inserted in the fifth intercostal space, which is around the under-arm area.Dr Jayaram agreed the drain he inserted was \"clearly not\" in this area, but said it was still in a \"good position\" and \"was working\".Mr Myers said the drain was in a \"sub-optimal\" position and \"risked interference\" with the heart.Dr Jayaram rejected this, adding he had \"never\" witnessed a drain interfere with the heart in the way suggested.\"It wasn't in the wrong place,\" he said.\"You very much focus on process, we have to look at outcome which was the crucial thing at the time. This made (Child H) more stable.\"Mr Myers reminded the court that in the hours and days following, Child H suffered a number of desaturations - two of which were \"profound\" and led to Child H needing CPR. Dr John Gibbs, who was a consultant paediatrician at the Countess of Chester in 2015, attended Child H's first serious collapse in the early hours of 26 September.  The infant needed three doses of adrenaline as medics battled for 20 minutes to resuscitate her. Dr Gibbs' notes from the time, shown to court, stated the reason for her collapse was \"unclear\". The consultant sketched out possible reasons for the collapse in his notes and suggested it could be a \"result of trauma from chest drains against the heart\", but he told the court subsequent ultrasounds \"showed that had not happened\".Asked by the prosecution whether such a drain could cause any internal issues, Dr Gibbs said: \"Not that I'm aware of. I wouldn't expect it to cause any trauma or damage to (Child H) at all.\"Child H was discharged from hospital on 9 October after she continued to improve and in a statement, her mother said her daughter had been \"absolutely fine and healthy since\".The trial continues.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Demolition of old hospital buildings including the old nurses accommodation ended in June last year. Without additional funding, no further work to prepare the site can take place.Health secretary Steve Barclay previously announced he had approved \"up to £28 million\" for the first stage but last week it emerged money for the second stage, the hospital, had not been approved.Whipps Cross redevelopment director Alastair Finney said his team could \"see no way\" construction could begin this year.He said the \"elephant in the room\" for the government was the shortage of funding for former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's flagship 2019 election pledge to build 40 new hospitals, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).At an health overview and scrutiny committee hearing, he said the health secretary had written to local MP Iain Duncan Smith saying he had approved the funding.\"Then we were told by the national hospital team that they needed to review the business case before they were able to confirm funding,\" he said.\"We now see no way construction of the car park can begin before 2024. \"The assumption is that the overall construction of the car park needs to be completed before the hospital can begin so it's not a positive picture.\"In a report to the Barts Health NHS Trust board on Wednesday, Mr Finney said the next steps remained unclear and that construction could only start in 2025 at the earliest, completing in 2028/29.Mr Duncan Smith, a Conservative MP, told LDRS he had personal assurances from Mr Barclay that \"there should not be any doubt about the funding and end result for a new Whipps Cross Hospital\".He added he would do everything he could \"to ensure the funds are released.\"Walthamstow Labour MP Stella Creasy tabled a parliamentary question to Mr Barclay on 11 January asking why no decision had been made on Whipps Cross. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has not yet responded.However in a statement, the department said final funding allocations were \"only confirmed once the full business case had been reviewed and agreed, including by HM Treasury.\"It added it was working with Whipps Cross \"to deliver state-of-the-art new facilities for patients and staff and ensure value for money\".A spokesperson for Barts Health NHS Trust said it was clear the project was in \"a period of significant delay\", but remained it \"positive\".Additional reporting by Josh Mellor, Local Democracy Reporting Service.Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

He was cleared of manslaughter and murder.An inquest later ruled out both unlawful killing and accidental death and recorded a narrative conclusion.Yousef's family were last year granted a judicial review, which has now quashed the original findings.Alison Mutch, senior coroner for Greater Manchester South, had concluded she could not be sure of the \"precise sequence of events\" leading to Yousef's death.But the High Court, sitting in Manchester, has rejected that conclusion.Lady Justice Macur and Mr Justice Fordham handed down their ruling and directed a fresh inquest be held before a different coroner.Yousef's family, from Burnage, Manchester, were granted permission for a judicial review last year.They challenged Ms Mutch's assertion that there was insufficient evidence on the \"central issue\" of whether Yousef's killing had been unlawful.During his trial, Manchester Crown Court heard Molnar, who was 17 at time of the stabbing, had claimed self-defence and told the jury that knives were produced after an argument broke out with his friend.The court heard Molnar, Yousef and another youth - Adam Chowdhary - had all carried knives that night.Molnar was subsequently jailed for 16 months for possession of a knife in a public place and perverting the course of justice by lying to police at the scene.At the original inquest, lawyers for the Makki family argued the coroner could still conclude Yousef had been unlawfully killed, even though Molnar had been cleared of murder and manslaughter.They said this was because the burden of proof in inquests was much lower than in criminal cases.In the former, the case only has to be proven \"in the balance of probabilities\" as opposed to \"beyond reasonable doubt\".Alistair Webster, KC, representing Molnar at the inquest, said Yousef's death had simply been a \"terrible accident\".Outside court following news that the fresh inquest had been granted, Yousef's sister Jade Akoum said she was \"overwhelmed\" since she had been expecting bad news.She said: \"They have given us another opportunity and hope... to shine a light on what happened.\"We have been failed by two courts now - the criminal court and the inquest.\"Finally for two senior judges to give us another chance... it's amazing.\"She added: \"Yousef deserves this - we will carry on.\"Barrister Matt Stanbury who represents the family said: \"We hope... there will be a very thorough examination of the evidence; the difficult questions will be allowed to be asked.\"We will be arguing again for an unlawful killing but first and foremost it is about a fair process.\"Yousef's family have set up the Yousef Makki Foundation to help underprivileged young people in education in Greater Manchester.\"Despite being from humble beginnings, Yousef was lucky enough to attend Manchester Grammar School on a full bursary scholarship and wished to become a heart surgeon after university,\" the family said when they launched it in March.They said they believed Yousef would have wanted them to do something positive in his name.Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

There were 57 letters of objection sent by residents over security, crime, and noise. The council also received 346 letters of support from individuals who want to see the disused land transformed.

The minerals absorb water, which can cause walls to crack and crumble.In November, a law firm representing mica-affected homeowners in the Republic of Ireland has said there could also be hundreds of cases in Northern Ireland.Fixing crumbling Londonderry home 'could cost family £100k'At that time Danny and Kate Rafferty, from Beragh Hill Road in Londonderry, estimated it could cost more than £100,000 to fix their home after mica was detected.That prompted calls from Foyle MP Colum Eastwood to ensure any homeowner in Northern Ireland affected by defective blocks should be protected as \"a matter of urgency\".The council said anyone whose property had been tested had the presence of mica confirmed should contact the local authority.Following years of campaigning in the Republic of Ireland, an expert panel was set up in 2016 to investigate problems with homes affected.In 2019, the Irish government approved a €20m (£17.2m) repair scheme.But many homeowners said that the scheme was not fit for purpose.In 2021, a compensation scheme for homeowners affected by crumbling blocks was announced by ministers.In September 2022, a 10% levy on concrete blocks was announced as part of the Irish government's budget.","Date":"2023-01-20 13:23:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-northern-ireland-64345218","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12CC2/production/_103049967_1422518_1420699138183377_38174156_n.jpg"},{"Topic":"N.

Ms Long, who leads the Alliance Party, served as Stormont's justice minister from January 2020 to October 2022.She said she raised concerns about PSNI disciplinary processes with the chief constable during her tenure.\"One of my frustrations was that whilst the police were taking the issue seriously, it often took a long time to reach conclusion and that added to public frustration,\" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\"There are a number of reasons why it takes so long. First of all, some of these issues don't simply go to the disciplinary [process] within police and professional standards.\"Some of them will emerge as part of ombudsman cases and there is an issue that until ombudsman reports are concluded that the police have been unable to take action.Ms Long added she previously discussed the issue \"in depth\" with the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland as well as the PSNI. \"Obviously, in most of those cases that are serious, people will be suspended but they'll be suspended on full pay and I know that has been in the public domain and concerns around that,\" she said.\"It is something that I think does need to be looked at, but there is some change needed actually - potentially in legislation - to be able to allow that to happen and that's something that we were actively exploring.\"Last July , BBC Spotlight revealed that two PSNI officers had been investigated for more than three years over allegations that they manipulated the body of a person who died by suicide in 2017 and shared photos and a video online.At the time, it was revealed one of the officers had been suspended on full pay while the case was investigated by the Police Ombudsman.On the wider issue of how the PSNI has handled allegations of domestic and sexual abuse within its own ranks, Ms Long said much training and investment had been done to challenge attitudes and change the organisation's culture.\"When you have organisations that are overwhelmingly male and that are very hierarchical in nature, there is a tendency for those organisations, whether consciously or unconsciously, to become sexist, misogynistic, \" she said.She pointed to examples of officers who were investigated for sharing pornographic material on their phones.Ms Long said it was important such cases were taken seriously so the public could have confidence when reporting sexual or domestic abuse that the person investigating their complaint was not also a perpetrator of abuse. Asked if she was concerned about the number of officers who had either been sacked or suspended over domestic or sexual abuse allegations, she said: \"I think out of around 7,000 officers, it's a reasonable proportion and it probably doesn't reflect all of the problem.\"It will be those that have come to light within the PSNI, those that have been raised, so I see it as a serious problem where it exists.\"I think the numbers in some ways are just indicative of the size of the organisation, but I think [the fact] that it exists at all is something that I believe the police need to deal with.\"In a statement to BBC News NI, the Police Federation for Northern Ireland said it had \"long held the view that disciplinary processes take too long to resolve\" and it welcomed \"recognition that things have got to change\".\"Careers are put on 'hold' which means officers are unable to progress from their current positions, and that is patently unfair,\" it added.In relation to suspension on full pay, the federation said the terms of suspension \"stem from police regulations and are deemed a neutral act that forms part of the process\". \"To penalise officers who are later retained in service, would be to financially sanction them when they may be later found to have done nothing wrong or be the subject of a minor misconduct sanction - that would be a travesty,\" the statement added.","Date":"2023-01-20 11:56:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-northern-ireland-64343785","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6E2E/production/_128360282_363fc01110f42933cede189c491b907e897555f4.jpg"},{"Topic":"N.

The £27m pledge means a long-awaited upgrade from the current vessel - the 37-year-old Good Shepherd.Trips for visitors, shipping in food supplies and even taking a car to the island will become a lot easier. The Good Shepherd service from Shetland, via the churning Sumburgh Roost tidal race, is slow, small and unreliable in poor weather.It can carry 12 passengers, who have to climb down a ladder to reach the seating area, and one car - loaded aboard by crane.The new ferry will allow cars to drive on and off for the voyage, which currently takes two hours 40 minutes from Grutness or five hours from Lerwick.Fiona Mitchell, who runs the island's post office, works as a fire fighter and teaches art at the primary school, says islanders \"can't wait\".\"It's fantastic news,\" Fiona says. \"For someone like me that sails on the Good Shepherd ferry and always needs a sick bag, I'm hoping the new ferry is going to be a wee bit more comfortable than the last one. \"It moves Fair Isle forward with the infrastructure, the new ferry, and with the new bird observatory coming on - it cements what we are looking forward to and have been asking for. \"It really says Fair Isle is here to stay.\"Fair Isle lies half way between Shetland and Orkney and has a population of about 60. It's just three miles long by half a mile wide. The remote island is famous for its knitwear and birds, not forgetting its place in the shipping forecast. A reliable 24-hour electricity supply was only established four years ago and its tiny primary school has just five pupils. Eileen Thomson grew up on Fair Isle, where her father was a skipper of the Good Shepherd, and decided to move back from Edinburgh with her partner Guillermon Rotolo six years ago.Their sons Luca, seven, and Ander, five, make up nearly half the primary school roll. \"We've been fighting for a new boat for over 10 years, closer to 20 years,\" Eileen says.\"It's the oldest ferry in the fleet in Shetland. It crosses the roughest piece of water. \"In recent years its refit takes weeks and weeks every year.

Drinks containers made from plastic, glass, steel and aluminium will all be included in the scheme.The Welsh government also hopes to introduce a digital deposit return scheme at a later date, a pilot of which ran in Conwy in 2020.

Both those factors limited customer \"churn\" she said.Revenue rose to $7.9bn (£6.37bn) in the fourth quarter. However, profit was lower in this quarter than the same period a year earlier, and profit for the year as a whole was down from 2021. Although Netflix remained \"ahead of its competitors\" on profitability, said Ms Reese.In early 2022, Netflix faced an uphill battle. It was facing increased competition from rivals such as Amazon, HBO, Apple TV and Disney. It cut hundreds of jobs, but still found it had to put up prices to customers to cover rising costs.That dealt a blow to its subscriber numbers in the first half of the year.In November, it introduced a cheaper ad-supported option in 12 countries, including most of Europe, the UK and the US, and signalled it would be less tolerant of password sharing in future. Netflix said it was \"pleased with the early results\" from the service.Although Netflix did not report how many subscribers signed up to the new ad-supported tier, Mr Peters said they would not have entered the space if they did not think it could be \"very successful\".\"And they've only started to crack down on password sharing in Latin America,\" said Simon Gallagher, former director of content acquisition at Netflix. He added that the next six months will decide how sturdy Netflix is, as it rolls out new pricing schemes across the UK and US, and focuses on stopping password sharing in those regions.\"Reed Hastings has been there for 20 years and I think he wanted to go out on top - this has been a successful quarter for them. But he will remain very engaged as executive chairman,\" added Mr Gallagher.The company could remain resilient, Mr Gallagher said, even as smaller streaming services continue to merge to compete with bigger services like Netflix.Netflix shares, which have fallen nearly 38% in the past year, rose in after-hours trading following the results announcement.Netflix started out in 1997 as a mail-order film service. Customers ordered via the website and DVDs were posted to them at home.Mr Hastings has sometimes said the idea for Netflix was sparked when he owed a large fine for forgetting to return a video cassette to rental shop Blockbuster and thought a model more like gym membership, with a monthly fee for renting films, would be better.

After Beth died, her family discovered she had helped countless people by writing honestly about her mental health problems. In the weeks after his daughter's funeral, Chris Matthews spent many mornings at her grave, nestled in a country churchyard, as he struggled to come to terms with her death.  One morning, as he tidied away some flowers that were beginning to fade, he discovered a fresh bouquet. Attached was a note which read: \"I probably should explain why a completely random stranger left this card and flowers on Beth's grave. Over the past year, her tweets and her blog have kept me alive.\"If you are suffering distress or despair, details of help and support are available here.It was written by Robert, who had travelled 200 miles from London to Beth's grave, overlooking the River Tamar in Cornwall. He had never met Beth, but wanted to thank her. Beth had written a blog which documented her mental health journey - including how she had survived and was recovering from a suicide attempt.Robert discovered it on a particularly dark day, when he had decided to take his own life. \"Instead, I couldn't stop reading it,\" he says. \"And when I finished, I was very sad, but the suicidal moment had gone. I thought, 'If Beth can get through this, then surely I can.'\"In a typical tweet to her 26,000 followers, Beth wrote: \"Suicide is not the answer. To anyone out there that is struggling, please believe me when I say things CAN and WILL get better.\"Robert says she saved his life. \"I would imagine, going through her tweets and replies, that there were probably thousands of people like me,\" he adds. On the surface, Beth's childhood was idyllic. Growing up by the sea, she loved sailing, becoming one of the youngest competitors in the renowned competition named after the Fastnet Rock off southern Ireland, which the race course rounds. \"I can still hear her squeal of delight when she was doing anything a little bit mischievous,\" remembers her sister Lucy.But despite her extrovert persona, Beth secretly struggled with her mental health for many years, and made a number of suicide attempts. Then on 8 April 2019, she was badly injured trying to take her own life. She was airlifted to hospital and spent two weeks in a coma, but remarkably survived and started rebuilding her life.Beth first spoke publicly about her recovery in a post on Facebook. \"She felt understandably nervous and anxious about it,\" recalls Lucy. \"She was writing about how she'd fought to be here and how much she wanted to be here. And she wrote so well.\"The post went viral. She started a Twitter account and a blog.

Melanie would message Beth on Twitter, asking for support. And Beth would reply. \"No matter what Beth was going through, even when she was in hospital, she was messaging me at 2am… telling you it's worth it, telling you you're worth it,\" she says. Melanie, from Sheffield, is compiling a book of messages from Beth's Twitter followers for her family. \"There aren't just a handful of us who think about Beth on a daily basis,\" she says, showing a tattoo she has to remind her of Beth.The chief executive of charity Mental Health UK, Brian Dow, says Beth had a special ability to explain the \"raw, really challenging moments\" that many people face. \"The effect of that was that thousands of other people who felt the same, stopped feeling alone,\" he says. \"We know that kind of willingness to share actually saves people's lives.\"Telling her story was part of Beth's attempt to move forward. She also bought a paddleboard and posted videos of herself, back on the water. \"I've been given a second chance at life,\" she wrote. \"I'm going to seize it.\"Her sister Lucy says writing her blog and helping others on Twitter gave Beth purpose.Her father Chris agrees. \"She was wise beyond her years,\" he says, choking back tears. \"She became such an enormous part of peoples' lives, people that she'd never met before.\" The power of Beth's writing comes from the unvarnished honesty of the pain she had experienced.In one tweet, she shares shocking images of the X-rays of her broken pelvis, saying they are a \"gentle reminder\" of why people should not try to harm themselves. \"When somebody is willing to think of others and to share their pain in such a raw manner, I think that takes a level of courage that frankly most of us don't possess,\" says Mental Health UK's Brian Dow.As part of her recovery, Beth met members of the Devon Air Ambulance team who had come to her aid, plus the police officer who had held her hand that day.PC Jessica Floyd - who says she will never forget the incident - wanted to speak in Beth's memory to urge anyone who was also struggling to talk to someone.\"Tell somebody how you feel. Know that you're not alone,\" she says. \"And whilst you feel very trapped in that situation, there are people out there who are there to talk to and to help you.\"Beth also used her experience to educate people in person. She told her story to young people at a Cornwall mental health unit. She helped train police negotiators in dealing with those threatening suicide, organised by an officer from Staffordshire Police who saw her online profile.\"We'd never had that insight before,\" says Sgt Nigel Roberts. \"It was electrifying. She was just resolute that she would do anything she could to help other people, help it not happen to them.\"Sgt Roberts and his team now routinely use knowledge and experience they learned from Beth when dealing with high-risk situations.Yet while she was doing so much to help others, Beth was still suffering with physical pain from her injuries and mental health struggles.    Her family sought NHS funding for treatment at a mental health unit run by The Priory Group - one of the UK's biggest private mental health care providers. Beth moved to the Priory Hospital Cheadle Royal near Stockport in November 2021. She tweeted in excitement: \"The funding for the specialist unit has been approved. I'm going to grab this opportunity with both hands.\"Beth's father remembers breathing a huge sigh of relief that, at least there, his daughter would be safe. Her family insist she could have got better, with the right care and treatment. \"When I last saw her, she said 'I do want to be here,'\" says Lucy.But Beth took her own life, on 21 March last year, after taking poison which she had ordered online and told staff was protein powder.An inquest jury concluded that Beth, who was being treated for a personality disorder, died from suicide contributed to by neglect.It found there had been \"inadequate care of a highly vulnerable patient,\" adding \"it was evident there were serious inconsistencies across all levels of her care plan\".The Priory said it fully accepted the jury's findings and acknowledged \"far greater attention should have been given to Beth's care plan\".A spokesman said: \"At the time of Beth's unexpected death, we took immediate steps to address the issues around how we document risk and communicate patients' care plans, alongside our processes for receiving and opening post.\"We want to extend our deepest condolences to Beth's family and friends for their loss.\"Beth's family feel let down and angry. But they take some comfort in her achievements.\"It wasn't until after her passing that we realised the impact she'd had on individual lives, when people came forward and left us notes and messages of support,\" says Lucy.\"It's just full of sadness that she didn't do the same for herself.\"","Date":"2023-01-20 02:05:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-64156223","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E27C/production/_128208975_bethnew.jpg"},{"Topic":"Science","Title":"Tim Peake retires as European astronaut","Article":"UK spaceman Tim Peake is stepping down permanently from his role as a European astronaut.He's going to take up a full-time ambassadorial position for science and space instead - work he's been doing since 2019.The former British Army Air Corps helicopter pilot was selected as a European Space Agency (Esa) astronaut in 2009.He flew to the space station for a six-month tour in 2015/2016.\"Being an Esa astronaut has been the most extraordinary experience,\" Tim Peake said.\"I have had the privilege of working with an exceptional team of dedicated individuals during the past 13 years with the agency, which has been incredibly exciting and rewarding. \"By assuming the role of an ambassador for human spaceflight, I shall continue to support Esa and the UK Space Agency, with a focus on educational outreach, and I look forward to the many exciting opportunities ahead.\"In a tweet following the announcement, he didn't rule out future trips into space.\"And as for getting back to space again - never say never!\" he tweeted.In November last year, Esa unveiled UK citizens Rosemary Coogan, John McFall and Meganne Christian as new astronaut candidates. Coogan is set to begin training in April; McFall is joining a feasibility study to see if he can fly as a disabled astronaut (he's a former Paralympic \"blade runner\"); and Christian is a reserve and could join the corps if someone else drops out. Tim Peake's selection into the Esa astronaut corps in 2009 was a surprise because the UK was not participating in the agency's human spaceflight programme at the time. But this policy changed as a consequence and now Britain plays its part, helping to fund the programme and send experiments to the International Space Station.The UK, as an Esa member state, is also involved in the US space agency Nasa's Artemis programme to go back to the Moon and will be supplying equipment for a new lunar space station.Dr Paul Bate, the UK Space Agency's CEO, said: \"Tim Peake is an incredible ambassador for the UK space sector and has played a leading role over the past decade.     \"Not only has he carried out important scientific work, during his historic Principia mission to the International Space Station and while on Earth, but he has inspired millions with his passion for space and the opportunities it offers.\"Hailing from Chichester, Tim Peake was the UK's first \"official\" astronaut, going into orbit on a government ticket. But he was preceded by other UK-born citizens, notably Helen Sharman, who went to the Mir space station in 1991 on a private programme organised with the Russians.A number of UK-born individuals were also able to fly before him with Nasa because they had acquired US citizenship - figures like Michael Foale and Piers Sellars.However, during his Principia mission on the ISS, Tim Peake did become the first person to complete a spacewalk while sporting a Union flag on his shoulder. The ISS tour also saw him control a rover on Earth remotely from orbit, help dock two spacecraft, and even run the London marathon on a treadmill.","Date":"2023-01-20 14:53:00.000Z","Url":"/news/science-environment-64346185","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/165D6/production/_128360619_8b88b051-b6f8-4abd-b4c7-a5935e596398.jpg"},{"Topic":"Science","Title":"Mission to Jupiter's icy moons ready for lift-off","Article":"Europe is about to undertake one of its grandest ever space missions, to explore the icy moons of Jupiter.The Juice satellite is going through final testing in Toulouse, France, after which it will be shipped to the launch site in South America.It's due to depart Earth in April.The six-tonne spacecraft will make a series of flybys of Callisto, Ganymede and Europa, using an advanced package of instruments to investigate whether any of these worlds are habitable.This might sound fanciful. The Jovian system is in the cold, outer reaches of the Solar System, far from the Sun and receiving just one twenty-fifth of the light falling on Earth.But the gravitational squeezing and pushing the giant planet gives its moons means they have the energy and warmth to retain vast quantities of liquid water at depth. And we know on Earth that wherever there is water, there's an opening for life.Prof Emma Bunce: The moons could be a new \"Goldilocks\" zone for life\"In the case of Europa, it's thought there's a deep ocean, maybe 100km deep, underneath its ice crust,\" said mission scientist Prof Emma Bunce from Leicester University, UK.\"That depth of ocean is 10 times that of the deepest ocean on Earth, and the ocean is in contact, we think, with a rocky floor. So that provides a scenario where there is mixing and some interesting chemistry,\" the researcher told BBC News.It's a 6.6 billion km journey lasting 8.5 years.Mark the calendar for July 2031. That's when Juice arrives at Jupiter. It will then conduct 35 flybys of the three moons before settling permanently around Ganymede in late 2034.WATCH: Jupiter's biggest moons moons - Callisto, Ganymede, Europa and Io - orbit the planet (Credit: Nasa/SwRI)The European Space Agency (Esa) project team behind Juice held a major review this week and concluded the mission was \"go for launch\".Aerospace company Airbus has spearheaded the construction of the €1.6bn (£1.4bn; $1.7bn) JUpiter ICy moons Explorer.The manufacturer has pulled in expertise and components from all across the continent.Everything is now fully assembled, including Juice's suite of 10 scientific instruments.\"We have a number of high-resolution cameras on this probe in all possible wavelengths - in infrared, the visible and ultraviolet,\" explained engineer Cyril Cavel, as he pointed out a collection of boxes hanging off one side of the silver and black satellite.\"You can see all these instruments underneath protective, transparent covers. The high-resolution visible telescope, which is called Janus, will take fantastic pictures very close to the moons because we will do flybys at just 400km altitude. They will be stunning shots,\" the Airbus Juice project manager said.Radar will also peer inside the moons; lidar - a laser measurement system - will make 3D maps of their surfaces; magnetometers will trace their complex electrical and magnetic environments; and sensors will sample the particles that whiz around them.Juice won't be searching for specific \"biomarkers\"; it won't be trying to detect alien fish in the deep oceans. Its job is to learn more about the possibilities for habitability that future missions could then investigate in more detail. Scientists have long pondered the idea of putting landers on one of Jupiter's icy moons to drill through its crust to the water below.That could happen one day, perhaps; in the latter half of this century. You need patience to work in the outer Solar System. The orbits of Earth and Jupiter may be \"only\" 600 million km apart, but you can't easily go direct, not without a stupendous rocket. And even though Europe's Ariane 5 is powerful, it doesn't have that kind of heft.Instead, it will send Juice on a rather circuitous route that will use the gravity of Venus and Earth to slingshot the probe out to the gas giant.Juice is built a little like an air-conditioned tank.Unprotected, its electronics would rapidly degrade in the harsh radiation that swirls around Jupiter. And that long journey inwards towards Venus and then out to the gas giant will see temperatures on the exterior of the satellite swing from 250C to minus-230C.\"We have two big vaults inside the spacecraft to protect the computers from radiation and to maintain them through a network of pipes at the same level of temperature,\" said thermal architect Séverine Deschamps.\"The same is true for the propulsion system. Its operation has to be maintained around the 20C, quite warm, to get a good level of performance when firing.\"Juice won't be alone in its work.The US space agency Nasa is sending its own satellite called Clipper.Although it will leave Earth after Juice, it should actually arrive just before its European sibling. It will focus on Europa.Together, the two satellites will make a powerful team.\"You get a much deeper understanding having the two there together, and it removes some of the guesswork as to what's going on,\" said Prof Michelle Dougherty, the principal investigator on Juice's magnetometer instrument.\"It will be interesting, for example, when Clipper is going past Europa if there is a plume coming from the moon. Clipper will be making the close-in measurements, but Juice will be watching at a distance to see what impact that has on the environment around Europa and whether we get bigger spots in the auroral lights on Jupiter.\"","Date":"2023-01-20 14:16:00.000Z","Url":"/news/science-environment-64336398","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0EC9/production/_128358730_juice-2.jpg"},{"Topic":"Science","Title":"Man arrested after fossils stolen in burglary","Article":"A large quantity of fossils - including dinosaur bones - was taken A man has been arrested after a burglary in which fossils, including dinosaur bones, were taken.Derbyshire Police said the break-in - at a property in Hardwick Square West, Buxton, Derbyshire, took place between 27 and 29 December.Other items taken included two guitars, a mandolin, jewellery and power tools.A 57-year-old man was held on suspicion of burglary, criminal damage and stalking and subsequently bailed pending further inquiries.The burglary occurred between 27 and 29 December, police said","Date":"2023-01-20 13:27:00.000Z","Url":"/news/articles/cydj2g7mer9o","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/c400/live/1f2f03e0-98b9-11ed-86bf-4b2f5da2cf01.jpg"},{"Topic":"Science","Title":"Glass bottles excluded from deposit return plans","Article":"The government's latest plans for a deposit return scheme for drinks containers have been criticised for excluding glass bottles. The scheme due to be introduced in 2025 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will cover plastic bottles and cans.According to the proposals supermarkets will host \"reverse vending machines\" where bottles are returned for money. The government says the UK uses more than 20 billion bottles and cans each year, many of which end up in landfill. \"This will provide a simple and effective system across the country that helps people reduce litter and recycle more easily, even when on the move,\" according to environment minister Rebecca Pow.  Waste management is a devolved matter but Westminster, the Welsh government and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland are working together on the plans. Westminster has decided that glass bottles will be excluded from the deposit return scheme in England and Northern Ireland. It says including them made the scheme too complex and they will instead by covered by the Extended Producer Responsibility scheme (in England and NI) which gives manufacturers targets to recycle them. That contrasts with the decision of the national governments in Scotland and Wales to include glass.\"At the final hurdle, this government bottled it and excluded glass from the scheme\", says Megan Randles from Greenpeace UK. \"In what kind of world is collecting glass drinks containers not an essential part of a system designed to collect drinks containers?\"Conservative MP Philip Dunne who chairs the Environmental Audit Committee called excluding glass a \"missed opportunity\" and said that though he welcomed the announcement he was disappointed it wouldn't start until 2025.No decision has been taken yet on the size of the deposit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with the government setting a target of 85% of returnable drinks containers using the scheme. In Scotland the deposit level has been set at 20p.The plans have been welcomed by soft drinks manufacturers and there will now be a period of consultation to prepare the infrastructure and to change labelling to try and make the deposit return system work smoothly. Many countries have much higher rates of recycling than the UK and have been operating similar schemes for years. Daniel Webb, who runs Everyday Plastic, an organisation which campaigns against plastic waste, welcomed the announcement. He told the BBC this was a chance to move away from a damaging \"throwaway culture and kickstart a real circular economy\".His organisation recently carried out a massive survey of plastic packaging waste with more than 100,000 people taking part and documenting more than 6.5 million items of plastic waste in a week. Just 7.5% of it was plastic bottles. \"Given our evidence, shouldn't the government be more ambitious in its scope?\" he said.

He and his colleagues published this discovery in the journal Science. It is the conclusion of 12 years of amateur astronomers and citizen scientists going out at night to count the stars. The change in stars' visibility that people reported - by submitting their star counts to an online project called Globe at Night - was equivalent to an almost 10% annual increase in sky brightness every year. That means, the scientists say, that a child born in an area where 250 stars were visible, would probably see fewer than 100 stars in the same location 18 years later.As light pollution researchers Fabio Falchi and Salvador Bará pointed out in an expert  commentary published alongside the research: \"Looking at the International Space Station's images and videos of the Earth at night, people generally are struck by the 'beauty' of city lights, as if they were lights on a Christmas tree. \"They do not perceive that these are images of pollution. It is like admiring the beauty of the rainbow colours that gasoline produces in water and not recognising that it is chemical pollution.\"Dr Kyba said he had hoped to see some signs of improvement in light pollution in recent years, because many urban centres have recently changed their lighting to be more energy-efficient. Towns and cities, particularly in developed countries, are swapping older streetlights for modern LEDS that are more carefully directed downwards, where the light is useful.    \"The hope was that if the light was better directed, the situation would get better,\" he said.  \"But there are so many types of lighting - streetlights, decorative, advertising. So, with all these things combined - and possibly more lighting overall - [we're] making sky brightness worse.\" According to a 2022 study by the European Space Agency the relatively low cost of LED lighting is also contributing to the problem. The agency described this as a \"lighting paradox\", explaining: \"While the LED lighting revolution promised to reduce energy consumption and improve human vision at night, overall [light pollution has] increased. Paradoxically, the cheaper and better the lighting, the higher society's addiction to light.\"Light pollution doesn't just reduce our view of the stars. It has been shown to affect human health and disrupt sleep patterns. It also affects the behaviour of some nocturnal animals, with one recent study linking it with local insect decline. \"It does not need to be this way,\" insists Dr Kyba. \"There's a lot of room for improvement - if you light more carefully, you should be able to reduce skyglow, whilst still lighting the ground.\"And remember that light pollution is wasted energy. We're continuing to put that light energy into the atmosphere, and maybe that's not what we should be doing.\"Additional reporting by Kate StephensFollow Victoria on Twitter","Date":"2023-01-20 00:39:00.000Z","Url":"/news/science-environment-64321824","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0A87/production/_128359620_light_pollution_v3_2x640-nc.png"},{"Topic":"Entertainment \u0026 Arts","Title":"Town's music festival to end after 16 years","Article":"Music of many genres was played in venues such as pubs, clubs and municipal buildingsA free music festival in a town that has been run by volunteers for 16 years will no longer be held.Hertford Music Festival said it was \"over\" as it was no longer able to comply with advice given by the Hertfordshire Safety Advisory Group (SAG).It said going forward it was \"impossible\" for five people to organise the annual Musical Mystery Tour (MMT).The advisory group, which consists of local authority and emergency service representatives, external, said its suggestions were \"advisory\" for the public's safety and wellbeing.The music festival has been held in the town for many years\"This is a very sad moment for us.

Jamal Edwards died aged 31 from cardiac arrhythmia after taking recreational drugs in February 2022. Speaking on BBC Radio 5Live on Thursday, Brenda Edwards said her son always helped others, and she was proud to carry on his legacy.\"It's spurred me on to continue to do the same that he used to do - he had such a big heart and he was so giving to so many.\"I was honoured to have the time with Jamal, he inspired me on a daily basis and his legacy continues to inspire me and so many people,\" she said.Jamal Edwards was credited with launching the careers of Dave, Jessie J and Sheeran on his YouTube music channel SBTV.He would mentor and pay for the music and video production for upcoming artists.Edwards championed Sheeran's music early in his career and put a video of him performing on YouTube in 2010.It caught the attention of his now manager, Stuart Camp and landed him a record deal with label Atlantic.Sheeran raps in his freestyle track, which carries a language warning, about spending more than a week with Brenda Edwards after Jamal Edwards died.\"We cried for nine nights at your family home….

He helped set up two major bands in the 1960s: The Byrds, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. He was renowned for his guitar-playing and vocal harmonies.His career saw him achieve the rare feat of being inducted to the revered Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. Former bandmates saluted Crosby's creative talents, while acknowledging the conflicts they had endured.Crosby's wife told showbiz site Variety that he died \"after a long illness\" while surrounded by family.\"His legacy will continue to live on through his legendary music,\" her statement added.Crosby was born in California on 14 August 1941, the son of Oscar-winning Hollywood cinematographer Floyd Crosby. He joined The Byrds in 1964 - a folk-rock group who scored their first hit with a cover of Bob Dylan's Tambourine Man, and whose other singles like Turn! Turn! Turn! and Eight Miles High helped change the face of American pop and rock.His tempestuous tenure - a period during which he also briefly dated singer Joni Mitchell - culminated in his being fired from the group three years later.Crosby then formed a supergroup with Buffalo Springfield's Stephen Stills and The Hollies' Graham Nash, who were later joined by another Buffalo Springfield star, Neil Young. Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young made one of their first appearances at the Woodstock in 1969, and later had a hit with Mitchell's song about the legendary festival.This band, too, was beset by in-fighting and broke up after a few years - although they have periodically reformed for concerts since.Hits written by Crosby during his time in the band included the hippy anthems Almost Cut My Hair and Deja Vu, and he responded to the 1968 assassination of Robert Kennedy with the song Long Time Gone.He became known for his countercultural politics and trademark moustache as well as his musicianship. A six-decade career culminated in his final album, For Free, released in 2021. The record saw him team up with one of his children, James Raymond, who had been put up for adoption soon after birth and only became acquainted with his father three decades later. Off-stage, Crosby had multiple run-ins with US law enforcement, including an arrest in 1982 on drug and weapons charges.His substance abuse had reportedly intensified after the death of a girlfriend in a car crash when he was a young man.There followed periods of ill health, and a liver transplant in 1994. Crosby's reputation for a hedonistic lifestyle saw him named two decades later as \"rock's unlikeliest survivor\" by Rolling Stone magazine.Crosby later expressed regret over his addictions and altercations with co-stars, telling the Los Angeles Times in 2019 he was \"ashamed\" of some of his past behaviours.Following the musician's death, former bandmate Nash expressed his \"profound sadness\" despite the two men's often \"volatile\" relationship, adding that Crosby left behind a \"tremendous void\".\"What has always mattered to David and me more than anything was the pure joy of the music we created together, the sound we discovered with one another, and the deep friendship we shared over all these many long years,\" Nash wrote.\"David was fearless in life and in music.\"Stills agreed, writing that his late collaborator was \"without question a giant of a musician\", even though they had \"butted heads a lot of the time\".\"His harmonic sensibilities were nothing short of genius,\" he added.Another tribute came from Beach Boys singer Brian Wilson, who wrote on Twitter that he was \"heartbroken\" at the news - as his fellow star had been an \"unbelievable talent\" and a \"wonderful person\".Crosby helped fellow singer Melissa Etheridge and her partner have two children by acting as their sperm donor through artificial insemination. Etheridge wrote on Thursday: \"He gave me the gift of family. I will forever be grateful to him, Django, and Jan.\"His music and legacy will inspire many generations to come. A true treasure.\"Crosby, Etheridge and their respective partners revealed his involvement through an appearance together with the two young children on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine in 2000.Asked why she chose Crosby, Etheridge told the magazine: \"He's musical, which means a lot to me, and I admire his work.\"In 2016, she said she had considered Brad Pitt, a good friend, as the donor, but decided against it because of the actor's desire to have a family of his own.\"I looked and I saw how badly he wanted children and I thought, I don't want to share this with someone who really, badly wants children because my children don't need another parent - they have two,\" she told Australia's Studio 10.Etheridge's family saw Crosby \"every once in a while\", she said, but Crosby and his wife Jan \"totally understood that we are the parents\".One of the children they conceived, Beckett Cypher, died in 2020 at the age of 21. Etheridge tweeted at the time that she \"joined the hundreds of thousands of families who have lost loved ones to opioid addiction\".Crosby said in 2021 that Beckett's death was \"hugely painful\". He told The Telegraph: \"It's never gonna get easy. You lose somebody you love and it hurts, that's how it is.\"Etheridge told The Guardian later that year that Crosby blamed himself for Beckett's addiction, thinking it might be genetic.\"But he can't. Everybody has choices. You can't just say: 'Oh, that's David Crosby's son, so…' That doesn't work at all.\"Crosby and his wife also helped actress Drew Barrymore by letting her stay with them for three months as part of her programme of recovery from alcohol and drug abuse when she was 14 in 1989.\"I'm an old Hollywood kid, and I knew her story,\" Crosby said at the time. \"I felt she had been dealt a short deck, you know, a fifth-generation alcoholic, and I didn't want to see her go down the tubes.\"Following Crosby's death, other famous fans paid tribute on social media.Tweets were sent from Crosby's own account the day before his death was announced - with one stating that Eleanor Rigby was his favourite Beatles to song to play on a rainy day.The exact cause of his death was not immediately specified.","Date":"2023-01-20 10:27:00.000Z","Url":"/news/entertainment-arts-64341315","ImgUrl":""},{"Topic":"Entertainment \u0026 Arts","Title":"Cathedral to close for The Crown filming","Article":"Preparation work is under way for what is believed to be the filming of the final series of The Crown.Winchester Cathedral is due to close to the public and location trucks have been seen on site which has been cordoned off.The fifth season of the Netflix historical drama about the monarchy charted the break-up of King Charles' marriage to Princess Diana.

You're experiencing all the emotions - rage, grief, sadness and tears. Coping strategies? You might binge a show, binge fast food, or unload your emotions into your private diary.Or, if you're a world-famous musician, you might decide to record a scorching diss track taking aim at your ex.Then, upload it to the internet, stand back and watch the sparks fly.At least, that's what Shakira did with Out of Your League, her song about footballer ex Gerard Piqué which has broken YouTube records.And she's not alone. Fans are convinced Flowers, by Miley Cyrus, is about her ex Liam Hemsworth.Not that pop superstars turning their raw emotions into songs is a new thing. Just ask Adele or Taylor Swift - both queens of the break-up ballad.Or Ariana Grande, The Weeknd and Justin Bieber - just some of the big names thought to have released heartbreak-inspired hits.But what's the trick to recording the perfect break-up song? And why are they so satisfying to listen to?The main reason for the genre's popularity is probably obvious: most of us get dumped (or do the dumping) at some point in our life. It hurts. We can relate.That's according to songwriting lecturer Martin Wright, who works at the British and Irish Modern Music (BIMM) Institute in Birmingham.He says the best break-up songs are all about the narrative.So what's the story?\"If it's me breaking up with you, it's about empowerment, liberation and freedom,\" says Martin. \"But if it's you breaking up with me, it might be about sadness, bitterness and even sometimes revenge.\" In Out of Your League, Shakira impressively manages to combine most of these elements into a single line:\"I won't get back with you, not if you cry, not even if you beg.\"Then there's the next ingredient - why the breakup is happening.\"Is it lovers scorned, or could it be something along the lines of life moving on and falling out of love?\" asks Martin.\"And then we look at what's happening now in a break-up song. So how does a person feel about their breakup?\"There are a few options here. A popular approach is the \"I'm so over this\", as demonstrated by Ariana Grande:\"I've learned from the pain/I turned out amazing.\"Or you could take a leaf out of Olivia Rodrigo's songbook and her more reflective take:\"And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone.\"And for the finishing touch, no good story is complete without an ending - what happens next? Martin says the chorus and looking to the future is the key here.You could strike a hopeful note, like Adele: \"Never mind, I'll find someone like you\".Or take the Beyoncé route:\"Baby I won't shed a tear for you/I won't lose a wink of sleep/'Cause the truth of the matter/Is replacing you is so easy.\"Or follow Taylor Swift's decisiveness:\"But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together. Like, ever.\" As well as being good to listen to, a break-up song can be helpful for the people writing them.Singer-songwriter Nahli, from London, says she starts writing \"in the raw state\" straight after a break-up.\"It's like you just have this lump in your throat, a heavy, horrible feeling and you feel sick,\" she says.Nahli, who has performed with the likes of Sigma, says she used to write her emotions down in her diary. Now she turns those journal entries into songs.\"When you've written them down in the moment, when you're crying into the page, and the tears are dripping down and smudging the ink...\"That's when all of my deepest emotions are coming out.\" Nahli's song Mama's Boy, on her album Therapy [Side A] is about a \"really tricky breakup\".\"This was more of a revenge [track]. I was irritated when I was writing the song,\" she says.\"I say some stuff in there that's so rude. Because in the moment, that's how I felt, I was so angry.\"And the only way that I could get those angry emotions out is because I wanted him to hear it.\"Another song called Relapse on the same album is about \"knowing that person was not very good for me\".\"Sometimes, when they creep back into your life, I was so scared to relapse if I said yes.\"For Nahli, the songs are a \"way of cleansing\" - the only way \"to demystify my emotions and get them out\".\"When I'm writing, I'm dismantling and pulling apart all these knots, and having them straightened out in front of me so that I can organise and process those emotions. \"Because once you can offload, it does feel like therapy.\"Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.","Date":"2023-01-20 00:16:00.000Z","Url":"/news/newsbeat-64305760","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8108/production/_128323033_gettyimages-1240898576.jpg"},{"Topic":"Health","Title":"Medics write to NI secretary over health crisis","Article":"Health leaders have written to the Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris asking for an urgent meeting over the health crisis in Northern Ireland.In the letter the senior medics asked for a meeting \"without delay\".They said this was due to the \"continuing alarming situation, pressures on staff and consequences on patient care.\"The letter said that the lack of functioning executive had caused \"an impossible situation\".Recently, the health service has been described as being under unprecedented pressure.Writing to Mr Heaton-Harris, the senior doctors and nurses said that they were seeing the dangers of \"normalising the unacceptable\". \"It is now commonplace to see patients receiving corridor care,\" the letter said. \"Ambulances are regularly stacked up outside waiting to offload very sick patients. \"There are patients waiting with huge delays for care to start in crowded Emergency Departments. They said that patients were being admitted for surgery that cannot be undertaken in routine circumstances anymore. Furthermore, prior to admission they have waited far too long, on what are labelled the worst waiting lists in the UK.The letter went on to say that for children, the situation was \"equally intolerable\". The medics cited some waits of up to four years and more for elective care to begin. The letter said paediatric services were dealing with \"unprecedented numbers\" coming to Emergency Departments and through outpatient wait lists. \"These waits are unacceptable with significant life development milestones missed and life chances irrevocably affected if care isn't timely.\"The senior medics said that nursing staff were \"leaving in droves because of unsafe staffing levels\". They also raised concerns over general practice (GPs) saying that the service is at risk of \"total collapse.\" They wrote that there was no other political avenue but to ask for this meeting. They said it was a \"privileged job,\" and that they had to speak up on behalf of colleagues and patients. The letter has been co-signed by the Northern Ireland leads for:They also acknowledged the efforts of the Department of Health in \"doing their best to make decisions whilst bearing in mind the accountability deficit and associated civil service limitations.\"While the health service is under pressure, the number of people awaiting admission to hospital from Emergency Departments across Northern Ireland has fallen.

No \"formal regulatory action\" was taken as \"there has been positive evidence of collaboration between the two organisations\" since the investigation.Four months on,  both trusts - which remain separate - have created a joint chair role and a Joint Partnership Board, which brings members of the two boards together to discuss common issues.Over the next two years the trusts hope to jointly \"retain and attract specialist doctors and nurses in hard-to-recruit areas\".Sue Page, the chief executive of South Tees, said the move was \"essential\" to \"retain specialist clinicians\" and recruit more.Julie Gillon, chief executive at North Tees, said creating one group would \"ensure that health inequalities for this region are addressed as a continued priority\".NHS England said it would continue to review progress on the integration.

The RCN says these will be the biggest strikes so far, affecting more than a third of NHS trusts in England and all but one Welsh health board.The union has about 300,000 members - roughly two-thirds of NHS nurses.The RCN and GMB unions in Scotland have put strike action on hold to allow talks on the 2023 pay offer. Ambulance staff A series of dates affecting different area have been announced:NursesLife-preserving treatment must be provided. All nurses in intensive and emergency care are expected to work. Anyone who is seriously ill or injured should still call 999, or 111 for non-urgent care.Most of the 73 NHS trusts involved in the February strikes are hospitals.The biggest disruption is therefore likely to be in pre-booked treatment such as hernia repair, hip replacements or outpatient clinics.However, services such as chemotherapy, kidney dialysis and intensive care will be staffed, as part of emergency cover.Ambulance staffThe advice remains to call 999 in an emergency.Those who have a fall, or suffer other non-life-threatening injuries are unlikely to receive 999 care. The RCN is calling for a 19% pay rise, although it has indicated it may be prepared to meet the government \"halfway\".  Ambulance workers also want above-inflation pay rises, but have not announced a figure. The government says the demands are unaffordable, and that pay rises are decided by independent pay review bodies.Fourteen health unions, representing more than a million NHS workers in England, said they will no longer work with the NHS Pay Review Body on discussions about the 2023-24 pay deal.The average salary for ambulance staff in England were £46,643 for April 2021 to March 2022, according to NHS Digital.Of this, £13,854 came from extra payments for things like shift work and overtime.Workers classed as support staff - such as ambulance technicians and non-emergency ambulance drivers - received £29,139 on average, of which £7,842 came from extra payments.The starting salary for a nurse is England is just over £27,000 a year. This is the bottom of pay band five of the NHS contract, known as Agenda for Change.Staff such as healthcare assistants, porters and cleaners are on lower pay bands.Workers are entitled to in-the-job increases within their pay band.A nurse with four years' experience could expect to earn close to £33,000 - the top end of pay band five. The most senior nurse consultants can earn up to nearly £55,000. PhysiotherapistsUp to 4,200 NHS physiotherapy staff across England will strike on 26 January and 9 February.The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) said further dates will be announced without an improved pay offer.Junior doctorsThe British Medical Association (BMA) opened a strike ballot for junior doctors on 9 January, which will run until 20 February.

They just haven't really changed.\"The source adds that the unions are \"digging in\" and \"announcing further strike dates makes it less likely there'll be a collegiate atmosphere\".There is a hope that given the prime minister's priority to reduce waiting lists, the Treasury might look favourably on the need for more money.\"They are busy elves in the Department of Health,\" smiles a source elsewhere in Whitehall.Those in the Treasury argue their focus is on cutting inflation and there will be no new money for striking workers.Instead there is what is called a \"Efficiencies and Savings Review\" going on across government.If departments can find savings from their existing budgets, they can spend them as they see fit.In other words: cut something you're already spending money on, and you can spend that money on pay. But you're not getting any new money.Others at the centre of government make a blunt economic and political calculation: if a deal is done with one union or one sector, all the others will demand the same - and that will cost a fortune.Enter - at one step removed from the government - the Rail Delivery Group, representing train companies, offering the RMT union a minimum pay rise of 9% over two years and guaranteed no compulsory redundancies until at least the end of next year.The union is considering the offer.Let's see what happens.Right now, it's a safe bet that across plenty of sectors this winter, there are plenty more strikes to come.Watch Make Sense of Strikes on iPlayer and find out more about why people are striking and whether industrial action works.","Date":"2023-01-20 10:50:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-politics-64344961","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B27F/production/_128359654_strikes_epa.jpg"},{"Topic":"Health","Title":"NHS trust has improved its mental health services","Article":"A NHS trust has improved its mental health services for children from 'requires improvement' to 'outstanding'.The Care Quality Commission (CQC) rated Somerset NHS Foundation Trust as 'good' overall following a recent inspection.The trust was formed in April 2020 with the merger of Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust.The CQC praised the trust for the quality of services after the merger.\"It's a remarkable achievement to merge trusts at the beginning of a national pandemic and yet Somerset NHS Foundation Trust have continued to maintain the good quality of service that we had come to expect,\" said Deanna Westwood, CQC director of operations.Somerset NHS Foundation Trust is the first trust on the English mainland to provide community, mental health, and acute hospital services.

It found:However:The hospital, part of Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, was not rated following the inspection in October and the previous rating of \"requires improvement\" remains.Karen Knapton, CQC head of hospital inspection, said staff were \"working hard under sustained pressure to deliver care\" and patients were treated with \"compassion and kindness\".But staff \"didn't always respect their privacy and dignity or keep their care confidential, due to people being able to overhear private conversations because of the pressures the trust was facing and lack of space\".Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: \"Though health and care services are incredibly challenged, we are working to address the pressures we're facing. \"We're recruiting nursing staff, we've taken further action to provide timely access to treatment, we've introduced more measures to monitor patients in the waiting room and we're working with local partners to support patients leaving the hospital with support in the community.\"Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Under trade union law emergency cover will still be provided and staff can leave the picket lines to attend.Ahead of previous strikes in January and December, patients were told that all Category 1 calls - classed as the most life-threatening situations, such as cardiac arrest - would be responded to by an ambulance. However, less urgent calls which are not immediately judged to be life-threatening (Category 2), might have to wait longer than usual for an ambulance but they would still respond to strokes and heart attacks. Urgent problems that fit into Category 3 - such as a woman in late-stage labour - would not be prioritised, the public was told.In all cases, patients with the most urgent clinical need will be given priority.Unite is the smallest of the three main unions in the ambulance service, meaning on some days only a couple of hundred ambulance workers across the country will actually be striking across the 10 ambulance services in England, those in Wales and Northern Ireland.Speaking to the BBC in the Political Thinking podcast, Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said staff were \"fighting for the NHS\".Ms Graham said: \"People are dying as we speak because of waiting times and the clogging up of the NHS.\"She called on Rishi Sunak to personally intervene on pay negotiations.\"If they don't solve the pay crisis, they can't solve the crisis of the workforce, which means that the NHS is on its knees,\" she said.Ms Graham said workers will ensure \"proper minimum cover because that is something that's really important to us\".\"Nobody wants lives to be lost,\" she added.The dispute centres on pay, with workers calling for above-inflation (10.5% in the year to December) pay rises. The government has made it clear it is not willing to move on this year's pay award.But the governments in England and Wales have given NHS staff an average of 4.75%, with everyone guaranteed at least £1,400 - as recommended by the independent NHS Pay Review Body.That is less than half the rate of inflation, although latest figures show the rate at which prices are rising has started to slow.One option being explored by Health Secretary Steve Barclay is backdating the 2023-24 rise to January. It would normally kick in in April. The Treasury has not agreed to the idea.This has already been tabled in Scotland, leading to NHS strikes being halted for further negotiations - although staff there received a 7.5% pay rise this year.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"It is disappointing some union members are going ahead with further strikes at a time when the NHS is already under huge pressure from Covid, flu and tackling the backlog.\"The Health and Social Care Secretary is continuing to have constructive discussions with unions about the 2023/24 pay review process and what is affordable and fair.\"","Date":"2023-01-20 09:16:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-politics-64336948","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/112FF/production/_128099307_gettyimages-1451100802.jpg"},{"Topic":"Health","Title":"'While I still have breath I will keep going'","Article":"Weeks after Kasha Gravill opened her tearoom, the country was plunged into lockdown. The cost-of-living crisis swiftly followed. Before Christmas, she was told she had terminal cancer. Despite this, Kasha continues to be a beacon of positivity in her community. BBC News' Kevin Shoesmith went along to meet her.\"If I didn't have any bad luck, I'd have no luck at all,\" quips Kasha, between gulps of tea in a corner of The Old Lamp Room, once an outbuilding used to trim wicks for workers' lamps at Cottingham station.She recognises how, in light of three major traumas to befall her, that statement may appear flippant. But she assures me, without prompting, this is a fair reflection of how she sees her predicament. \"This isn't a front - it's me,\" she says, matter-of-factly. \"It's sink or swim, fight or flight. I've chosen to swim and fight.\"It will not get me down.\"Like the lamps that once lit the way for railwaymen, she has become a ray of light in England's largest village.The Old Lamp Room is a stone's throw from Platform 2, with the business enjoying plenty of trade from passengers.\"Patients come from all over to attend appointments at Queen's Centre for Oncology and Haematology here in Cottingham,\" she tells me. \"They'll often come in for a cuppa and a slice of cake. I realised, through our social media, that I could help them, so I have started to tell my story on there, helping reassure others.\"Kasha tells how she had been fearing a bone biopsy after reading horror stories online. \"The reality, when I had it done, was very different to what I'd read. It was over with so quickly and I wasn't in any pain, only a little discomfort. I decided to share that experience.\"At the entrance, Kasha has placed a chalkboard sign. On it, is the 'quote of the day' - \"You can't measure a dream!\"\"I'd always wanted my own tearoom,\" says the 57-year-old mother-of-one. \"It really was my dream. When I was shown this battered old building I remember saying, 'you are having a laugh'. It was in such a poor condition and so small. But the size has served us well because we have created a lovely, intimate place.\"Kasha roped in her partner of 21 years, Mark Vines, to help transform the building into what it is today, completing the majority of the work themselves. \"I broke a fair few fingernails in the process,\" she laughs, handing over a book containing photographs charting the transformation. \"We literally took it back to its bare bricks.\"The Old Lamp Room, leased from Northern Rail and Network Rail, opened in 2020.\"Five weeks after opening, the country was placed in lockdown,\" explains Kasha. \"We were heavily restricted as to what we could do. But we found a way. We served food through a hatch and we started delivering food. People were going mad for afternoon teas. One haulage firm even placed an order for 250 cream teas.\"Sasha breaks off to bid farewell to two customers.We pick up again at the cost-of-living crisis.\"We'd just turned a corner then prices went up,\" she says. \"It's been ridiculously hard. But we can't have customers sitting in the cold. We make our food from scratch, so costs are high. Getting hold of ingredients has been really hard; at one point we couldn't get hold of flour and enough eggs.\"Our chef Louis has been fantastic throughout, producing cost-effective food with whatever we could get hold of. Dishes have had to change week to week due to shortages.\"Last November, Kasha was given the news she had cancer. And it was terminal.\"I'd had a bad back for some time,\" says Kasha. \"But being busy I'd put off going to see someone about it. One day I collapsed. A scan showed the secondary cancer was in my back.\"The primary cancer was later traced to her breast, although she points out there was no lump.\"I cried,\" says Kasha. \"I still have good and bad days now but staying positive is massively important to me. The inevitable will happen, as it will everyone, but I've been given a heads-up. I can get all my ducks lined up. I see myself as fortunate.\"Customers speak highly of Kasha. Christine Wilson, who comes here every day, tells me: \"I'm devastated for her. I'm also in awe of her.\"Kasha tells me a \"prerequisite\" of working here is being positive.\"We leave our sadness at the door,\" she says. \"That's Kasha's Law. When you come here, you're surrounded my friends and laughter.\"I find assistant Sarah Smith dishing up a slice of cake and ask her to describe her employer. \"Absolutely potty,\" she laughs. \"But a lovely, lovely lady. She has proven nothing is going to stop her and we're all helping her do that.\"        Kasha notices a spot of woodwork that requires a lick of paint.\"We'll have to do something about that,\" she says, turning to her partner who tells me: \"She never stops.\"Kasha laughs. \"I work best under extreme stress, and while I still have one breath in my body I will keep going.\"If you have been affected by issues raised in this article, there is information and support available via the BBC Action Line.Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

There is also a stark shortage of care workers who work in people's own homes.\"The difference you can make to people's lives is just unbelievable,\" said Kate Ball, a senior care worker at Abicare in Bradford on Avon.She said her profession has felt largely \"ignored\" in the discussion over the future of the health service - \"after Covid, we were just like nothing,\" she added. \"We can make a difference to the ambulance sat outside the hospital, to the bed blocking,\" said Mrs Ball, who described carers as an \"invisible army\".But she added that right now too many who need their help are left waiting due to a lack of staff.Like many, Wiltshire's hospitals have been struggling with long ambulance handovers and delays in A and E, caused in part by a lack of beds available in wards.  \"The hospital is really full,\" Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust Chief Executive Stacey Hunter told BBC Radio Wiltshire earlier this month. \"We are caring for at any one time 100-plus people who are medically ready to leave the hospital but need some kind of ongoing care and are not able to access that in a timely way.\"Councils are responsible for coordinating social care in their areas. Wiltshire Council said it recognises the staffing problems are a \"significant problem\" at the moment and is urging the government to provide \"clarity about funding\" in future.The council said it is working hard to help speed up discharges but Wiltshire's cabinet member for Adult Social Care, Conservative Jane Davies, warned: \"without a sustainable market we're just not going to be able to give people the care they need and deserve.\" Health Secretary Steve Barclay has said the government is funding \"the biggest increase in history into social care, an extra £7.5 billion over the next two years.\"The government added that the NHS is being given £250m to buy thousands of beds in care homes and upgrade hospitals this winter.Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
