[{"Topic":"War in Ukraine","Title":"'Sometimes it's better to retreat, then crush the enemy'","Article":"Ukrainian forces have acknowledged \"stepping back\" from the bitterly contested Donbas town of Soledar, captured by Russian forces last week in their first significant victory after many months in retreat. But soldiers have told the BBC they've pulled back in a controlled and tactical move before a planned counter-attack. Long bursts of automatic gunfire rattled across the grey, stubbled fields on the front line between Soledar and the neighbouring town of Bakhmut, during an intense gun and artillery battle.\"It's quite close. One kilometre,\" said a tall Ukrainian unit commander named Andriy, peering around the corner of a ruined cottage and towards a dark line of trees to the east.It was impossible to be sure what was happening. But the sound of automatic gunfire, zinging overhead, in addition to the constant boom of rockets and artillery, suggested that Russian infantry were close. A press officer for the 46th Air Assault Brigade, who was accompanying us on a visit to the area, said the front lines were constantly shifting, unpredictably, sometimes by several kilometres a day.\"We have a tough situation here,\" Andriy acknowledged, before slipping into a well-disguised command bunker hidden amid the ruins. His team had just received detailed information about a Russian armoured personnel carrier (APC), spotted by a Ukrainian drone. Moments later, there were three loud outgoing blasts from a nearby UK-supplied light artillery piece, used here by Ukrainian forces, and aimed at the vehicle.\"Every day we destroy 50 or 100 enemy people,\" Andriy claimed.The fighting in and around Soledar has been some of the heaviest of the war, with Russian forces - spearheaded by the mercenaries and convicts of the Kremlin's Wagner group - reportedly suffering heavy losses but finally succeeding in taking control of the small hill-top town, now a wasteland of flattened buildings and rubble. Privately, some Ukrainian soldiers have blamed poor co-ordination between different units for the loss of Soledar and have acknowledged that Russia may now be better placed to encircle the far bigger and strategically more important neighbouring town of Bakhmut, to the south.But the mood among front line units in villages like Paraskoviivka, now just a few hundred metres from Russian positions, appears to be quietly confident. Furious Ukrainian air and artillery bombardments appear to be blocking Russian attempts to move forward both from the north and from the south-western outskirts of Bakhmut.\"It's a controlled situation. I believe in my commander. Sometimes it's really better to take a step back… then after that to make a [counter] attack and crush the enemy. Each day we're destroying enemy positions,\" said Andriy.On a grey morning this week, a light thaw turned the snowbound country lanes on the northern edge of Bakhmut into muddy tracks. During winter there is precious little cover from trees and bushes, leaving many roads visible and vehicles exposed to Russian artillery fire. As we took cover behind a small cottage, a shell crashed into the road 300m behind us. Our military escort said the fighting had reached a new pitch of intensity, with the boom of rockets and artillery fire coming every few seconds, amid the wail of sirens from Ukrainian ambulances whisking the wounded back to a field hospital.\"We have gun(shot) wounds, we have shrapnel wounds. The fighting here seems to be particularly intense. We also have (cases of) frostbite and flu. And people are tired,\" said Dr Andriy Zholob, the commander of the 46th Brigade's medical unit. But he insisted morale among the soldiers remained high.\"They're tired, they're cold, they're wounded. But they ask me, 'Doc, when can I return?' They don't want to say - 'I'm wounded, now I can relax.' Their hearts are burning still. We have work to do,\" said Dr Zholob, scrolling through a video showing him removing mortar shrapnel from a soldier's shoulder.Closer to Bakhmut, two Ukrainian jets roared overhead, as artillery and tanks, hidden in the fields, continued to pound Russian positions.","Description":"Ukrainian forces have acknowledged \"stepping back\" from the bitterly contested Donbas town of Soledar, captured by Russian forces last week in their first significant victory after many months in retreat.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz is under increasing international and domestic pressure to supply German-built Leopard 2 tanks or at least approve their delivery by third countries. Poland and Finland have both promised to send their Leopards - but need Germany's permission to do so. But Berlin is still in talks with the US about its official position. Many expect an announcement to follow a meeting of Ukraine's Western allies at the American military base of Ramstein in southwestern Germany tomorrow. Reports suggest that Mr Scholz will only give the green light to the Leopards if the US President Joe Biden agrees to supply American Abrams tanks. However, the Pentagon's top security adviser, Colin Kahl, said late on Thursday that the US wasn't prepared to meet Kyiv's demands for the tanks.\"The Abrams tank is a very complicated piece of equipment. It's expensive. It's hard to train on. It has a jet engine,\" Mr Kahl said.A senior German government source told the BBC that reports of a deadlock between Berlin and Washington over tanks were overstated, but they're causing concern amongst Ukraine's Western allies.The provision of Western battle tanks - in sufficient numbers - is widely seen as crucial if Ukraine is to defeat Russia or, at the very least, defend itself against Russian President Vladimir Putin's anticipated spring offensive. Yet, to date, only Britain has promised to supply them. Other countries, including Germany, France and the US, have sent or pledged to send armoured vehicles as well as air defence systems and other heavy equipment. Meanwhile, Kyiv's demands for tanks are growing increasingly urgent. So why is Mr Scholz dithering over their delivery? All indications are that he will allow third countries to supply their Leopards - the German Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck said so a week or so ago. But Mr Scholz has not yet committed. He's cautious for several reasons. Germany worries - albeit less so than it did in the past - about escalation and how Russia's Vladimir Putin would react to the supply of offensive weapons. It's a reasoning which many experts perceive to be unjustified. And the concept of German tanks on Ukrainian soil still resonates uncomfortably in Berlin, where the country's World War Two history still casts a long shadow. Mr Scholz may have declared a \"Zeitenwende\" (sea-change) in Germany's stance on defence and military policy following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but he's still mindful that, less than a year ago, the idea of the German government supplying arms to a conflict would have been unthinkable. The Chancellor has his eye on the domestic opinion polls. As one senior government source put it to me, surveys suggest the public are broadly satisfied with his reaction to Ukraine - unlike his policies and performance in many other areas. A recent survey for the national broadcaster found that 41% of the public thought Germany was supplying the right amount of weapons, 26% thought its support went too far and 25% that Germany wasn't sending enough. Mr Scholz has promised that Germany will play a greater military role on the world stage, but years of underinvestment have left its armed forces in a parlous state. Even if the Chancellor gives the green light to sending Leopards, the arms manufacturer Rheinmetall has warned that renovation and preparation requirements would delay their delivery by months. Mr Scholz doesn't want to risk the perception that he's acting alone, hence the desire to co-ordinate with allies and, in particular, the US. And it's why there's unlikely to be an announcement ahead of the Ramstein meeting tomorrow. But his position has triggered frustration and condemnation in international political and security circles. They say Germany - still a political heavyweight - must step up to its military responsibilities.","Description":"Germany will only send battle tanks to Ukraine if the US does the same, multiple reports suggest.

A survey of Scotland's voluntary sector, seen by BBC Scotland, found 93% of organisations that responded reported an increase in costs in 2022 - and 43% said these rises were negatively impacting their ability to deliver services. There are about 45,000 charitable organisations in Scotland and the SCVO warned a \"conservative estimate\" was that 1,300 would be unable to open their doors in a year's time.Mr Bradley said: \"We're deeply concerned. \"We're fearful for the thousands of voluntary organisations at risk, but I'm also fearful for the people that need to access that vital support.\" The Royal Voluntary Service is one such organisation affected - on Wednesday it confirmed it will stop offering some of its services in Aberdeen and Moray from next month. The charity, one of the largest voluntary organisations in the UK, said it will close its transport and home support services due to a lack of available funding.But smaller community organisations are particularly worried, as they often receive less funding and national publicity.Girvan Youth Trust, which supports about 300 young people in the Ayrshire town and surrounding villages, saw its gas bill increase by 100% in the past month alone.The trust runs six days and nights per week, including club nights, employment projects and a support group for young people with additional support needs.Project coordinator Gail McMaster said the service was vital.\"Lots of our young people that visit us are vulnerable,\" she said. \"One of the biggest increases we've seen is young people coming to us and they're hungry, so they'll attend a group at night and their parents are under huge pressure to work more hours.\"So that knock-on effect is a teenager may come home from school and not have eaten, not come into a warm home, not have a warm meal.\"Ms McMaster said that to address this, the club is putting on more free food and they \"don't charge young people a penny\" to come into any groups.\"We will never do that, because as soon as we charge to come in, the most vulnerable people won't be able to attend,\" she said.However, it used to cost between £39,000 to £44,000 \"just to open the doors\" to the centre - a price which Ms McMaster said could increase to £65,000.\"As a small charity, we are not funded by a local council or the government,\" she said.\"In the long run, I don't know whether small charities will be able to continue running.\"Niall McShannon, who is managing director of Clydesdale Community Initiatives (CCI) in Lanark, feels as though local volunteer organisations have been \"abandoned\" despite all the work they did during the pandemic.CCI supports people with complex needs to \"make a contribution to their community\".This includes activities from growing food to working in their wood shop and social enterprises to make products to sell for the community.\"The demand for people to access activities like ours is higher than I've ever known it in 35 years of working within the sector,\" Mr McShannon said.\"At the same time we have considerable financial stresses and the funding environment is exceptionally difficult.\"During the pandemic, Mr McShannon said the CCI was part of an \"amazing\" community response that received a great deal of recognition from local and national governments - something that has since slipped away.He said this is particularly frustrating as organisations such as CCI can reduce demand on the health and social care services.\"It feels as though we're the easiest to drop, when in fact we could be a significant part of the solution for a relatively small investment,\" he said.To address the financial black hole that many voluntary organisations are facing, the SCVO is calling on the Scottish government to bulk purchase energy on better terms for voluntary organisations to access.They are also urging the government to give greater support for staff and volunteers through the cost of living crisis.Mr Bradley added that despite 5% of the Scottish workforce being based in the voluntary sector, they haven't heard a great deal about pay for those staff delivering public services.A Scottish government spokesperson said: \"We recognise the strain the current cost crisis is placing on charities and third sector bodies and are looking at a range of measures to help. \"It is already the case that some third sector bodies are part of the bulk-buying arrangements that we have in place for the wider public sector.

But new research by the University of Quebec in Canada suggests that pods may not be as wasteful as preparing coffee using a traditional coffee maker. The study gives new insight on the climate impact of the world's most popular drink: it is estimated that two billion cups of coffee are consumed daily worldwide, with the average American drinking three cups a day.While coffee is prepared in a variety of ways, coffee capsules have risen in popularity since their invention some four decades ago. The market value of coffee pods grew 24% from 2021 to 2022, bringing in $12.33bn (£9.92bn) globally. Despite their popularity, capsules have long divided coffee drinkers who are conscious of the effect their caffeine habit has on the environment. The small plastic or aluminium pods have been criticised for being energy-intensive to produce and for causing \"unnecessary waste\". The German city of Hamburg even went as far as banning their use from state-run buildings in 2016.However, researchers now say that pods may not be as wasteful as other ways of making coffee, especially when looking at the broader life cycle of a single cup.In their study, a literature review of research done on coffee consumption over the years, the researchers measured the total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions produced by each method of preparing 280 millilitres of coffee. Their analysis considered the entire process - from production of the coffee beans (which is the most GHG-emitting part) to the amount of waste that ends up in a landfill after the cup is finished. The outcome slightly differed based on how the coffee is prepared. For example, researchers also looked at emissions when more coffee than needed is used - a common occurrence as most people don't measure their coffee before they prepare it. They also analysed the difference of emissions in the Canadian province of Alberta - the second highest GHG emitter in Canada - versus Quebec, which has the lowest emissions.How much coffee is good for you? - in 90 secsEach time, the study found that traditional filtered coffee produced the most amount of carbon dioxide. This is because of the amount of coffee powder that is needed to make a cup of coffee is higher, as is the energy that is needed to heat up the water and keep the coffee warm. On average, the method that produces the second-most emissions is brewed coffee using a French press, also because of the amount of coffee that is needed to make a single cup. Coffee capsules are third on the list. The amount of coffee inside each capsule is controlled, which prevents overconsumption - a capsule saves between 11 to 13 grams of coffee, the study found. Instant coffee is the most environmentally-friendly way to make a brew, the study found, because it uses less coffee, and water kettles use less energy than the traditional coffee maker. \"Paradoxically, this type of coffee does not follow the current consumption trend in North America,\" study co-author Luciano Rodrigues Viana said. On the surface, one thing that coffee drinkers are unable to control is how much emissions coffee production itself actually produces.\"The agricultural phase is the most polluting,\" Mr Viana said. No matter the method in which the coffee is prepared, the harvesting and production of the beans makes up 40% to 80% of emissions, as growing coffee uses intensive irrigation, fertilisation and the use of pesticides. It is why coffee capsules are not as harmful as using more coffee than one needs to make a single cup despite the perception that pods cause more physical waste. \"I don't think that capsules are a miracle solution,\" Mr Viana said. \"But it is a good example that illustrates our cognitive biases.\"With the life cycle of a coffee cup in mind, Mr Viana advised people to drink smaller amounts of coffee. This means opting for 50ml to 100ml espressos, or ensuring that only the needed amount of coffee and water is used when preparing a cup to avoid waste. And even when using capsules, Mr Viana cautioned against overconsumption as the ease of coffee pods may encourage people to drink more altogether, which then produces more waste. \"Reusable pods, if used for a long time, are a solution to reduce the amount of waste,\" he added.","Description":"When it comes to making a cup of coffee, capsules have a reputation for being environmentally unfriendly, as they are often hard to recycle.

In four areas, there was not enough data to make a reliable assessment.\"The situation is poor across the board, with adverse trends across marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments,\" it said.Of the 23 environmental targets it looked at, it assessed 14 as \"off track\" while the remaining nine could not be assessed because the evidence was not available.A spokesman for Defra said it would publish a new environmental improvement plan later this month that would help it to meet its targets to protect the natural world, tackle climate change and halt the decline in species populations by 2030.Richard Benwell, CEO of campaign group Wildlife and Countryside Link, said that the report showed that \"rapid, concerted action and investment\" was needed if environmental targets were to be met.\"To halt the decline of nature, the days of fluffy wish lists, and back-of-the-settee funding for nature policy must end,\" he added.The OEP - set up under the 2021 Environment Act to hold the government and other public bodies to account - said there had been \"a frequent failure\" by the government to meet its own legally-binding targets.It said the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis had worsened a lack of coherence in environmental strategy within Defra and across government.\"Overall, we do not think the current pace and scale of action will deliver the changes necessary to improve the environment in England significantly,\" the report said.Dame Glenys Stacey, the chair of the OEP, said there now needed to be co-ordinated action across all levels of government and improved data collection and monitoring to ensure targets were being met.\"Progress on delivery of the 25 Year Environment Plan has fallen far short of what is needed to meet government's ambition to leave the environment in a better state for future generations,\" she said.Despite some improvements in air quality and people's engagement with nature, she said: \"Many extremely worrying environmental trends remain unchecked, including a chronic decline in species abundance.\"A Defra spokesperson pointed to the work it had done since it published its 25 year environmental plan in 2018, including the funding of more than 120,000 hectares of nature recovery projects, increased tree planting rates and restoration of peatland.

And nature alone will not remove enough of it from the air.CO2 is the most important gas warming the planet, and is emitted when fossil fuels such as gas and oil are burnt.\"To limit warming to 2C or lower, we need to accelerate emissions reductions. But the findings of this report are clear: we also need to increase carbon removal too,\" says lead author Dr Steve Smith from Oxford University. \"Many new methods are emerging with potential.\"There's consensus among scientists that the world is warming primarily because emissions of CO2 (estimated at 33 billion tonnes in 2021) far exceed the amount that is being removed (this report suggests two billion tonnes a year). Until emissions and removals are balanced - so called \"net-zero\" - global temperatures are predicted to rise.But getting there won't be easy. The latest UN climate reports say to fully achieve \"net zero\" there will need to be some CO2 removal, so called \"negative emissions\", to compensate for sectors that can't easily decarbonise. Currently almost all of the world's CO2 removal occurs through natural processes. That's primarily plants and trees taking in CO2 from the air, and the soil absorbing and storing it. But there are limits to how much nature can do. For example, how much more of the world can realistically be given over to forests? Some optimistic scenarios suggest that natural CO2 removal could be doubled by 2050, but that's still only about 4 billion tonnes of CO2 a year. This new report titled \"The State of Carbon Dioxide Removal\" says that to restrict and reduce global temperatures in the future there needs to be investment in developing technological solutions now. The methods it cites are all fairly new, and at different stages of development and deployment. Put together they currently only make up a tiny fraction of the worlds CO2 removal.One, known as BECCS, involves incorporating CO2 capture into biomass-based electricity-generation, in which organic matter such as crops and wood pellets are burned to produce power. Other options include: huge facilities where the carbon is extracted from the air before being stored in the ground; the use of specially treated charcoal (biochar) that locks in carbon; and  \"enhanced rock weathering\" - loosely based on the carbon removal that occurs with natural erosion. The use of CO2 removal technologies is not without its critics. Some campaigners doubt that they can be cost effective and fear   that they can be an excuse to defer and delay the transition away from fossil fuel use.This report stresses that removing CO2 should not be seen as a \"silver bullet\" to tackle climate change but that meeting the UN's climate goals will require technology as well as nature to reduce greenhouse gas levels. That all assumes that global CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels will, as pledged at numerous climate summits, fall rapidly. So far yearly emissions have yet to start a downward trend.  Follow Jonah on Twitter @jonahfisherbbc","Description":"Technology to remove the planet-warming greenhouse gas CO2 from our atmosphere must be urgently ramped up, leading climate experts say in a new report. \"There's consensus among scientists that the world is warming primarily because emissions of CO2 (estimated at 33 billion tonnes in 2021) far exceed the amount that is being removed (this report suggests two billion tonnes a year). Some optimistic scenarios suggest that natural CO2 removal could be doubled by 2050, but that's still only about 4 billion tonnes of CO2 a year. This new report titled \"The State of Carbon Dioxide Removal\" says that to restrict and reduce global temperatures in the future there needs to be investment in developing technological solutions now. The use of CO2 removal technologies is not without its critics.\n","Date":"2023-01-19 01:57:00.000Z","Url":"/news/science-environment-64321623","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5720/production/_128340322_gettyimages-487818021.jpg"},{"Topic":"World","Title":"","Article":"Some unlikely fighters are strengthening the Somali government's arsenal in its long war against al-Shabab, one of al-Qaeda's most successful affiliates - and which was behind a twin car bomb explosion in the capital, Mogadishu, last weekend that killed at least 120 people.Images of men in sarongs and flip-flops running about with guns are one of the most enduring stereotypes of conflict in Somalia. Footage of these be-skirted fighters careering through smashed-up cities, firing wildly as they go, is shown again and again, much to the annoyance of Somalis who say this is not a fair or accurate representation of their society.Somalis call these sarongs \"ma'awiis\". They usually come in muted colours, decorated with abstract designs originating in Indonesia.Many men use them as everyday wear, while others put them on to relax in the evenings or to recline more comfortably while chewing the narcotic leaf khat.Now men in sarongs, or \"ma'awiisley\", have become a powerful new weapon in the battle to bring an end to the country's 15-year Islamist insurgency. These groups of clan fighters have sprung largely from nomadic and farming communities living under al-Shabab, which controls vast swathes of territory in southern and central Somalia and imposes strict rules on those who live there.Although the Islamist militants have a powerful network of spies who monitor every aspect of people's lives and punish severely those who disobey, a grassroots movement has risen up against them.As the worst drought in 40 years takes hold and famine creeps ever closer, people can no longer afford to pay taxes to al-Shabab.With more than three million heads of livestock perishing from lack of food and water, they can no longer hand over animals demanded by the militants.They can no longer bear to hand over their sons and daughters to serve as cannon fodder and sex slaves. They have simply had enough. Small groups of nomads and farmers have periodically risen up against al-Shabab in recent years, only to be crushed mercilessly.This time the ma'awiisley militias are larger and more co-ordinated, and are provided with ammunition, food and fuel by the government. Security analysts say some of them are rehatted members of the Somali National Army.\"The insurgents are now facing an insurgency of their own,\" says Mohamed Mubarak, chairman of the Mogadishu-based Hiraal security think-tank.\"If this spreads nationwide, I don't think al-Shabab will survive.\"The jihadists' reaction to the ma'awiisley shows how seriously they are taking them.They have embarked on a spree of burning homes, destroying wells and killing business people and elders who belong to the same clans as the ma'awiisley fighters. In a recent speech to graduates of al-Shabab training camps, its spokesman Sheikh Ali Dheere described the ma'awiisley as \"the robbers and rapists that roamed the country before al-Shabab came to power\". But Musa Idris Hassan, a member of a ma'awiisley militia in central Somalia's Hiran region, disputes this.\"We are nomads. We have always been warriors. We have lived under the militants for years so we know everything about them including where they hide.\"We will crawl into every bush to find and slaughter them all. We have no fear of al-Shabab or anyone else.\"The ma'awiisley are not acting alone. They form a crucial part of the government's new strategy to fight al-Shabab, which includes US airpower, African Union (AU) soldiers, foreign-trained Somali elite forces, the national army and troops from the country's five federal states.\"I have never seen the international community so excited about the war against al-Shabab,\" says the architect of this new approach, National Security Adviser Hussein Sheikh-Ali.\"The ma'awiisley are a key addition to the battlefield. They give legitimacy to our war against the militants because they come from the communities they control.\"They play an essential support role by providing the intelligence which enables our special forces to go in and smash the insurgents. We are now on the road to defeating al-Shabab completely.\"Amina Musa lived for 13 years under the control of al-Shabab in the central town of Booco, which was taken back by the government in September.\"The ma'awiisley are much better than the army,\" she says. \"They fight from their hearts not their stomachs.\"They are more motivated because their lives have been directly affected by the Islamists, who have stolen their children, their animals and everything that is good about nomadic life. Their anger is real.\"The addition of local clan militias to what Somalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has described as \"the total war\" against al-Shabab has made a difference on the ground.Security experts say Somalia has recovered more territory between June and September than it did in the last five years. But beating back al-Shabab is not enough. The challenge is to hold territory.The militants have a long history of staging tactical withdrawals then marching straight back in once the army and AU troops move on. If the government is to succeed in its \"total war\", it will need to replace al-Shabab's far-reaching governance structures and social services, including police forces, courts, taxation systems, schools and health facilities.According to Mr Mubarak, the authorities will also need to work out what to do with the ma'awiisley, who he warns could turn out to be a poisoned chalice.\"This strategy will only work if the ma'awiisley are disarmed or subsumed into the regular security forces after areas are recovered and their local issues solved before launching liberation operations, especially in areas with existing local conflicts,\" the Hiraal security expert says.\"Otherwise, Somalia risks being confronted by the new danger of having clan militias armed to the teeth and turning on each other. This could take us back to the clan wars of the 1990s.\" The recent gains against al-Shabab suggest the current cocktail of international, regional, formal and informal Somali forces is working on the military front.Dozens of towns and villages have been seized in recent weeks. Combined with the government's efforts to disrupt financial flows to the militants and challenge their ideology, this could be the answer to weakening the movement significantly, if not defeating it entirely.More on al-Shabab and the drought:","Description":"Some unlikely fighters are strengthening the Somali government's arsenal in its long war against al-Shabab, one of al-Qaeda's most successful affiliates - and which was behind a twin car bomb explosion in the capital, Mogadishu, last weekend that killed at least 120 people.

A new bill due to go through parliament will raise the official age at which people can stop work from 62 to 64. Public transport has been badly hit and many schools are closed.Turnout was significant at some of the 200-plus protests across France. The biggest is due to take place in Paris.The big unions were set to march from the Place de la République across the city during the afternoon.Tens of thousands of protesters marched during the morning in cities including Nantes, Lyon, Bordeaux, Marseille and Toulouse, as train drivers, public sector workers and refinery staff walked out. On some rail lines, as few as one in 10 services were operating, while the Paris metro was running a skeleton service. The main secondary education union said 65% of teachers were on strike, although the education ministry said it was 35%.Philippe Martinez, head of the CGT union, predicted more than a million people would take to the streets. Police were out in force in Paris in case of violence from ultra-left \"black bloc\" infiltrators. Under the proposals outlined earlier this month by Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne, from 2027 people will have to work 43 years to qualify for a full pension, as opposed to 42 years now.Hailed by the government as a vital measure to safeguard France's share-out pension system, the reform is proving deeply unpopular among the public, with 68% saying they are opposed, according to an IFOP poll this week.All the country's unions - including so-called \"reformist\" unions that the government had hoped to win to its side - have condemned the measure, as have the left-wing and far-right oppositions in the National Assembly.President Emmanuel Macron was on a visit to Spain on Thursday, but Labour Minister Olivier Dussopt warned that some opponents were using the issue to spread \"fake news\" and play on people's fears.Because his Renaissance party does not have a majority in the Assembly, President Macron will be forced to rely on support from the 60 or so MPs of the conservative Republicans party. Although in principle in favour of pension reform, even some of them have warned they could vote against.With the parliamentary process expected to take several weeks, Mr Macron faces a rolling campaign of opposition, with further days of action likely in the days ahead. The worst outcome for the government would be rolling strikes in transport, hospitals and fuel depots - effectively bringing the country to a standstill.Political analysts agreed the mood of the country was hard to gauge, so it was impossible to predict whether the scale of the movement would be enough to force the president into a retreat. If that happened, it could mark the end of any serious reforms in this, his second term.On the one hand, inflation, the energy crisis and constant reports of run-down public services have left many people feeling anxious and irascible. President Macron's poor image outside the prosperous cities contributed to the \"yellow-vest\" insurrection four years ago and could well do so again.But on the other hand, pollsters have also identified a sense of resignation among many people, who no longer identify with \"old-school\" social movements such as those the unions specialise in. Many will also be too concerned about the loss of a day's income to go on strike.The prime minister invoked the principle of \"inter-generational solidarity\" to justify the decision to make people work longer. Under the French system, very few people have personal pension plans linked to capital investments.Instead, the pensions of those who are retired are paid from the same common fund into which those in work are contributing every month. Workers know they will benefit from the same treatment when they retire.However, the government says the system is heading for disaster because the ratio between those working and those in retirement is diminishing rapidly. From four workers per retiree 50 years ago, the ratio has fallen to around 1.7 per retiree today, and will sink further in the years ahead.Nearly all other European countries have taken steps to raise the official retirement age, with Italy and Germany, for example, on 67 and Spain on 65. In the UK it is currently 66.President Macron made an earlier, and more ambitious, attempt to reform the system at the end of 2019, but pulled the plug when Covid hit. This second plan was part of his re-election manifesto last year - a key argument deployed by the government in the battle for public opinion. To palliate the effects of the reform, Élisabeth Borne has promised easier ways to retire early for people in dangerous or physically demanding jobs; steps to encourage older people back into the workforce; and a higher guaranteed minimum pension. The opposition argues the system is not technically in deficit at the moment, so there is no urgency to act. It says there are cost-saving alternatives to making people work longer, such as cutting pensions for the better-off.It also says the brunt of the reform will be borne by the poorest. These are people who tend to start work earlier in life, so have normally earned the right to a full pension by the age of 62. Now they will have to work two extra years for no added benefit.This is the seventh French pension reform since President François Mitterrand cut the retirement age to 60 in 1982. Every subsequent attempt to reverse that change has led to mass opposition on the street - though in most cases, the reform did in the end go through. For example, in 2010, Nicolas Sarkozy raised the retirement age to 62, despite weeks of protests.","Description":"Watch: Protesters held flares and played drums in strikes across FrancePresident Macron's reform programme faces a make-or-break moment, as French unions stage a day of mass strikes and protests against his plans to push back the age of retirement.

Mr Kohberger was arrested last month for the fatal stabbings of four University of Idaho students, and faces murder charges.Police are yet to find a murder weapon - described as a \"fixed blade knife\" - or a motive for the killings.The accused has not yet entered a plea.At Mr Kohberger's residence and office, police recovered \"a collection of dark red,\" cuttings from a pillow stained reddish-brown, part of a mattress cover with stains, a nitrate type black glove and a possible animal hair strand, according to the search warrant. A dog belonging to one of the murdered students, Kaylee Goncalves, and her ex-boyfriend was found at the Moscow, Idaho apartment when local police officers initially came to the murder scene. Other items found include receipts from Walmart and Marshalls, a Fire TV stick and a dust container from a vacuum cleaner. Police have also released a probable cause affidavit stating the reasons behind Mr Kohberger's arrest, including that his DNA was matched to a knife sheath found at the crime scene. Authorities had previously located Mr Kohberger's car, a white Hyundai Elantra, which matches the description of a sedan seen near the crime scene. Mr Kohberger faces four counts of first-degree murder in the fatal stabbings of Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen, aged 21, and Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin, both 20.They were all killed in an off-campus apartment on 13 November.

crush outside Iraq football stadium","Article":"At least one football fan has been killed and 60 others injured in a crush outside a stadium in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, local media report.It happened as tens of thousands of fans headed to the Basra International Stadium to watch Iraq play Oman in the final of the Arabian Gulf Cup.Officials said many were hoping to be allowed in despite not having tickets.A medical source told state-owned Iraqi National Agency (INA) that some of the injured were a critical condition.Videos posted on social media appeared to show several people lying motionless on the ground and medics trying to resuscitate a man.A huge crowd was seen stretching along a road to the stadium hours before the match, which was due to kick off at 19:00 local time (16:00 GMT).An AFP news agency photographer inside the stadium reported that the turnstiles had not been opened before the crush happened. Fans with tickets were later allowed into the stadium before the turnstiles were closed again and those still outside urged to leave. Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Sudani was said to be overseeing the situation on the ground, while the Iraqi army asked people in Basra to allow the Arabian Gulf Cup to be \"wrapped up in a civilised fashion that does honour to Iraq\".Iraq had to apologise to neighbouring Kuwait earlier this month after chaos in the VIP section of stadium prevented the emir's representative from attending the opening match.This is the first time Iraq has hosted the biennial Arabian Gulf Cup - which is contested by Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Iraq and Oman - since 1979. The tournament was intended to offer a more positive image of the country after many years of conflict and political turmoil.","Description":"At least one football fan has been killed and 60 others injured in a crush outside a stadium in the southern Iraqi city of Basra, local media report.

Ms Ardern, 42, was born to a Mormon family in the North Island city of Hamilton. Her father was a police officer. From that conservative background, she went to Waikato University in Hamilton and did a communications degree and then rejected Mormonism because of its stance on homosexuality.She worked for former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and for Tony Blair's UK government, before being elected an MP in 2008. By 2017 as the Labour Party saw its poll ratings stay low under the dour leadership of Andrew Little, she was elected his deputy and quickly developed a following. Mr Little resigned eight weeks before the election, and Ms Ardern took over.During the election campaign, she was dismissed by her critics as offering little more than stardust. But under New Zealand's proportional representation system, even though Labour won only 36.9% of the vote against the centre-right National Party's 44.5%, it was able to become the government after forming a coalition with the populist New Zealand First party.That proved to be a political millstone around Ms Ardern's neck as the party's mercurial leader, Winston Peters, opposed many of Labour's cherished policies, such as a capital gains tax.Ms Ardern made Mr Peters minister of foreign affairs and largely left him alone, initially taking, it seemed, very little interest in non-domestic matters herself.That all changed with the massacre, and she found herself heading an international effort along with French President Emmanuel Macron called \"the Christchurch Call\" to try to get social media companies to restrict the ability of users to post live violent videos, as the Christchurch gunman had done.But her big foreign policy challenge was New Zealand's relationship with China, its biggest trading partner and biggest source of tourists and, for a long time, migrants.New Zealand became widely regarded as the most pro-China of the Five Eyes partners, which led to tensions with Australia.Mr Peters tried to subtly swing New Zealand's foreign policy emphasis back to its traditional partners: the UK, the US and Australia. It was left to Ms Ardern to steer it back to the independent stance the country had adopted when the US forced it out of the ANZUS security agreement in 1985.By 2018 she was already becoming an international celebrity, having given birth to her daughter Neve while PM.She was the first female world leader to bring an infant to the UN meeting in New York as she and her partner Clarke Gayford sat through the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit with Neve.She visited Beijing for a day in 2019 and spent most of it in meetings with President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Keqiang.But she also visited the White House, London and regularly went across the Tasman to meet Australian prime ministers.However, she could not persuade either Scott Morrison or Anthony Albanese to relax their policy of deporting any New Zealand-born person who had been sentenced to more than 12 months in prison, the so-called 501 deportees.At home, Covid defined her prime ministership. Almost continuously for two years, she held daily media conferences, which were streamed and became must-view briefings for the large segments of the population forced to stay at home by lockdowns.But her party and her caucus were becoming impatient: they wanted their government to leave a legacy of progressive reforms.So, after the 2020 landslide, no longer in coalition with the conservative NZ First Party, Labour launched a raft of reforms covering water, the health system, resource management and planning, broadcasting and climate change. Added to that was a renewed emphasis on Maori rights under the Treaty of Waitangi and decolonisation, which saw a  new history curriculum for schools and increasing moves to co-Maori-European governance of public bodies.Each reform provoked opposition, and by the middle of last year, after a prolonged anti-vax protest camp on Parliament's lawn had finally been removed after a violent confrontation between protesters and police, a substantial anti-Ardern mood was evident, particularly in provincial New Zealand.Data released in June last year indicated that police-recorded threats against Ms Ardern had almost tripled over three years.Consequently, a long-standing tradition of the prime minister hosting a barbeque at the grounds where the Waitangi Treaty was signed on Waitangi Day had to be cancelled.She leaves office with the bulk of her reform agenda either still waiting to be passed or in the very early stages of implementation.So at this stage, her legacy is primarily of style, of an accessible, empathetic politician who preferred \"kindness\" to confrontation and was ultimately less admired at home than she was overseas.Her real legacy will have to wait.","Description":"Jacinda Ardern resigns: ‘I no longer have enough in the tank’Jacinda Ardern came to the prime ministership of New Zealand by what amounted to an accident and had her five-year term defined by a series of crises.

At least nine people died in the chaos and confusion.Among those kidnapped was Hassan Usman, a barrister based in Kaduna, and his wife.He told the BBC that the bedraggled group of abductees - made up of 39 men, 18 women and five children - were forced to trek for four days to the remote area where they were to be held captive, walking in the heat without food and only being given occasional water to drink.The 47-year-old became the de facto spokesperson for the captives, some of whom were held for five months, and has since set up a WhatsApp group for the survivors so they can give each other comfort and support.Seeing the smartly dressed lawyer today, it is hard to comprehend that he was the shaggy haired man in grey overclothes who pleaded for the government to heed to the demands of the abductors as other hostages beside him were flogged in a video released in July by the militants.He says it was a harrowing experience for all the captives but particularly the women who had to deal with unhygienic conditions.They had no sanitary pads and were forced to use rags. They all drank water from the small nearby lake where they were also allowed to bath.\"During the first few months, we were sleeping openly on bare ground which was sometimes wet, but when the rains started they made makeshift camps and allowed us inside only until the showers stopped,\" said Mr Usman.The captives ate once a day at 11:00 - usually a soup made from corn flour and baobab leaves.\"We realised that the food items were being smuggled in and that getting supplies was a problem. They occasionally brought rice which we cooked with just palm oil and sometimes with beans,\" he said.There were days when they were allowed a second meal at 18:00, but this was rare.\"The women did the cooking and the men did most of the chores like fetching water, firewood and washing the utensils.\"For weeks, the identity of the kidnappers was unknown - with speculation that they were members of bandit groups notorious for kidnapping for ransoms in the north-west.But Mr Usman confirmed growing suspicions that the gunmen were members of the Islamist Boko Haram militant group that usually operates in the north-east where it started its insurgency in 2009.There have long been suggestions that the group, which says it wants to overthrow the government and establish an Islamic state, is expanding southwards.\"They told us that they were Boko Haram and they captured us to drive some of their demands from the government.\"Sometimes they gave us their phones to listen to most of what they preach,\" he said, explaining these included sermons from Boko Haram's first two leaders Mohammed Yusuf and Abubakar Shekau - who are both now dead.\"They even tried to persuade us to join their group and propagate their cause.\"When any of the captives fell sick or needed medication, the militants would seek advice.\"They would always ask the professionals among us, the drugs needed to treat people and they mostly bought [them],\" the lawyer said.\"Their charlatan doctors also administered injections to the sick especially for malaria and typhoid treatments.\"At one point, the leader of the kidnappers suggested he take the younger captives to his house for better care, but the parents resisted, Mr Usman said.'Destitute after ransoms paid'While most of the victims of the train attack were released after their families and associates paid huge ransoms, the kidnappers held on to others to make demands of the government.Some analysts suggest this may have included the release of militants held in prison - though this has never been confirmed.Mr Usman said his family negotiated his release with the militants - though they have never shared the details of the agreement with him.All he knows is that it was not a straightforward process and on the day he was to be freed it all went wrong.\"The soldiers patrolling along one axis refused to allow my people access to the meeting point to pick me.\"This prompted the militants to make the torture video and he was only released the next day.The ransoms some families paid have left them destitute - he said the sum for several of the captives was as much as 100m naira ($225,000; £184,000) each.On the WhatsApp group, where the survivors now regard each other as one big united family, people recount their dire situations.\"Many cannot afford three meals a day, some were given a notice to leave by their landlords,\" said Mr Usman.The lawyer bemoaned the lack of help given to the survivors, many of whom need trauma therapy.\"We have a Ministry of Humanitarian Services whose responsibility is to help such people - I think there is need for its intervention at the moment.\"One of the women who was abducted sobbed as she spoke to me about her months in captivity.The woman, who did not want to be named, vowed never to travel between Abuja and Kaduna again - by rail or road - as she was so traumatised by her experience.Many thousands of people frequently commute between the two cities as government workers often cannot afford to rent in Abuja.They chose to leave their families in Kaduna or states further north and travel home at weekends to see them.The train, which opened in 2016, had been considered a safer alternative to the highway - the most notorious road in the country for kidnapping ambushes.Other survivors admitted they would feel apprehensive about boarding the train again, but Mr Usman has welcomed the reopening of the 174km (108-mile) train link - due to happen on Monday morning.His advice for the government is to ensure adequate security measures and 24-hour surveillance of the rail track.Nigeria's defence chief Gen Lucky Irabor has sought to reassure them, saying that CCTV had now been installed and even he and the president would be able to \"see everything happening on the line from their offices\".","Description":"Nigeria's reopening of a vital high-speed train link nine months after an audacious hijacking is bringing back traumatic memories for some of the survivors, who are struggling to recover from their ordeal.

Armenian reports said the commander had been sacked because of the fire.Border tensions with Azerbaijan have been high ever since the two countries fought a six-week war in 2020 over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding territories.The situation has escalated in recent weeks because the only road into Karabakh has been blockaded by Azerbaijani protesters. The territory is populated by ethnic Armenians, but inside the internationally recognised borders of Azerbaijan.","Description":"Fifteen Armenian servicemen have died and three more were critically injured in a blaze blamed on soldiers trying to light a fire with petrol. \"The prime minister also said clear instructions had been issued to the armed forces, banning flammable substances including petrol for heating purposes.

Many of her fans are women, who have avidly followed her journey from newbie PM to working mother and have looked up to her as a role model.Ardern is not the only prominent figure to make the news in recent years for announcing a shock withdrawal because of burnout - others include athletes Naomi Osaka, Ash Barty and Virat Kohli; and bosses like James Packer.But Ardern also holds that very rare position of being a working mother while leading a country. She gave birth while in office, only the second world leader to have done so after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto. In many ways, it was an extreme test case of balancing work and family. But there were clearly political factors at play as well.Her resignation comes amid growing political headwinds, with her approval ratings falling as New Zealanders' concerns rise over living costs and crime rates.It's always tough at the top, but Ardern's tenure has seen many challenges: steering the country through an unprecedented pandemic, a horrific domestic terror attack, and a volcanic eruption. Ardern noted in her speech on Thursday the \"constant and weighty\" decisions she faced.She has also had to contend with intense public scrutiny throughout her journey, from announcing her pregnancy just months after taking office to her decision to take six weeks of maternity leave, which sparked debate on whether it was too short.For a while, she appeared determined to tackle it head on.\"I always expected, given [Neve] is still so young and so small, that there would be a real tension there between making sure I was meeting all of her needs and of course my responsibilities. But I am confident with all of the support I'm very lucky to have, we will absolutely make it work,\" she told reporters at the time. She was also happy to share her parenting travails on social media, from the struggle to bake the perfect birthday cake for her daughter, to finding a diaper cream stain on her jacket after spending the day in meetings.But in the end, it was the human costs of high political office she cited in the most emotional part of her resignation speech. \"Politicians are human. We give all that we can, for as long as we can, and then it's time,\" Ardern said, her voice faltering. \"And for me, it's time… I know what this job takes, and I know that I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice.\"She talked about how she wished to spend more time with her family as they had \"sacrificed the most out of all of us\". She said she looked forward to \"being there\" for her daughter when she begins school, and told her partner Clarke \"let's finally get married\". Many had hoped to see her continue forging a path and will be disappointed that she could not go any further, but they will no doubt also have sympathy for her predicament.There is, of course, a political calculation in her decision. She has had a meteoric rise to power fuelled by \"Jacinda-mania\", but New Zealand's love affair with her has since soured as her government struggles to navigate post-pandemic economic challenges such as the rising cost of living and  deepening social inequality..Just weeks ago, her approval rating hit its lowest level since August 2017 - just before she became PM - as her Labour party also saw sliding popularity. Despite her denials, Ardern's move can also be seen as a canny decision to save her party and avoid a personally humiliating defeat in the upcoming election as the incumbent PM. Some of her critics celebrating her exit even accuse her of using her burnout as an excuse to salvage what is left of her political reputation.Regardless of whether this is burnout, or a walkout from a tricky political situation, or indeed both, some will inevitably see her departure as a powerful statement that it's important to set boundaries and respect personal limits.Jacinda Ardern herself said in 2018: \"I am by no means the first woman to multitask and in terms of being a woman in politics, there are plenty of women who carved a path and incrementally have led the way to be able to make it possible for people to look upon my time in leadership and think, yes, I can do the job and be a mother.\"Jacinda Ardern resigns: ‘I no longer have enough in the tank’","Description":"For millions around the world, Jacinda Ardern's resignation comes as a shock - but some women will pore over her words with particular interest.

base.Italian police said jewellery, gemstones and silverware were found in the hidden chamber.Empty paper boxes were also found, suggesting that potentially revealing documents were cleared out after Messina Denaro was arrested on Monday.He had been attending a chemotherapy session at a private clinic in Sicily.Shortly after being apprehended, the Mafia boss was taken to a prison in L'Aquila, in the central Italian region of Abruzzo, where reports say he will continue to receive treatment for his cancer. On Thursday, Messina Denaro declined to appear via videolink at a hearing on the 1992 killings of judges Paolo Falcone and Giovanni Borsellino.The killings are only two of the crimes Messina Denaro - a former boss of the powerful Cosa Nostra organised crime group - has been found guilty of. Italian media reported that there are signs the second hideout - a small chamber barely big enough for one person - had been inhabited \"recently\". The bunker is in a house about 300m from the Mafia boss's first hideout in the Sicilian town of Campobello di Mazara.Car keys found in the bag Messina Denaro was carrying at the time of his arrest led investigators to that first location. Police raided the location on Monday afternoon and found a 60sq m ground floor flat, which was described as \"comfortable\". Italian media said that luxury perfumes, expensive furniture and designer clothes were found at the location, as well two cell phones and Viagra pills.Police had been hunting the mafia chief for three decades when he was caught on Monday. He had made the appointment at the clinic under a false name.The alias, Andrea Bonafede, aroused the suspicion of police when they realised it was the name of deceased Mafia boss Leonardo Bonafede's nephew. Phone-mapping showed the real Bonafede's mobile was not in Palermo in 2020 and 2021 when a man using the name had surgery in the city.During his time at the top of the Cosa Nostra organised crime syndicate, Messina Denaro oversaw racketeering, illegal waste dumping, money-laundering and drug-trafficking. Watch: Moment Matteo Messina Denaro is detained in Palermo, SicilyHe was convicted in absentia in 2002 of a string of murders.Details of how Messina Denaro lived before his arrest have been starting to emerge. He was living in an unassuming house in Campobello di Mazara, 116km (72 miles) from Palermo and just 8km from his birthplace of Castelvetrano.A neighbour told Italian TV he frequently saw the man and that they would greet one another regularly.","Description":"A second hideout used by Italy's most wanted mobster Matteo Messina Denaro has been discovered at the back of a wardrobe with a sliding base.

Mr Gwin has since apologised for his actions, describing them as indefensible. In the clip which went viral online, he was seen standing outside his business, directing the stream of water directly onto the woman sitting on the pavement outside for several seconds - eventually stopping to tell her to move away.Among those who expressed outrage at the video was the city's mayor London Breed, who said last week it reminded her of how police treated civil rights protesters during the 1960s. One local man, Alex Sakiyama, told San Francisco news station ABC7 he felt the incident was \"really disturbing\", adding that the woman sleeps rough in the local area and can often be heard screaming at night.\"I think it's not okay no matter how bothered you are in any given situation. I think it's not okay to spray water at someone,\" he said. Announcing the charge, San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said: \"The alleged battery of an unhoused member of our community is completely unacceptable. Mr Gwin will face appropriate consequences for his actions.\"But she also noted that \"the vandalism at Foster Gwin gallery is also completely unacceptable and must stop - two wrongs don't make a right\".San Francisco Police originally responded to the incident on Montgomery Street in the city's Financial District around midday local time on 9 January, but said both Mr Gwin and the woman \"declined further police action at that time\", the force said. But the investigation was later handed over to the the force's Street Crisis Response Team, who investigated the incident further and requested an arrest warrant from the district attorney.Speaking to local radio station KPIX last week, Mr Gwin said: \"I'm very, very sorry, I'm not going to defend myself, I'm not going to, because I can't defend that.\"He told the station the incident had happened after trying to get the woman help, letting her sleep in his doorway for days and cleaning up after her.Mr Gwin added he and other local business owners had previously called police and social services more than 20 times over two weeks.","Description":"A San Francisco art gallery owner who sprayed a homeless woman with a hose has been arrested, police have said.

Others on board are reported to have included one passenger each from the UK, Australia, Argentina and France.The plane came down in a gorge near the airport of Pokhara, a tourist town. It is not yet known what caused the crash.However, searchers have recovered the Yeti Airlines plane's voice and flight data recorders and both are said to be in good condition.Here are some of those on board who lost their lives.Australian authorities have confirmed Sydney teacher Myron Love, 29, was among those killed.Friends have paid tribute to avid cyclist and surfer as a \"truly kind, fun, energetic man\", with one telling local media he had \"never met a more genuine bloke in my life\".In a statement, his family said Myron had been their rock.\"He has put so much into his short life that most of us couldn't fit into our lifetime.\"The 45-year-old father surnamed Yoo was a sergeant in the South Korean army. He was on holiday with his 14-year-old son during the son's winter break from school. The two left South Korea on 14 January for a hiking trip in the Himalayas. They had been messaging their families on the day when the incident happened, but the families didn't hear anything from them after the flight's scheduled arrival time passed, South Korean media reported.They told their families that they travelled from India to Nepal that day. They had planned to visit several places in Nepal, the reports said.The four men, all thought to be in their 20s or early 30s, were from Ghazipur in India's Uttar Pradesh state. They were among five Indians on board.Locals in Ghazipur said they had gone to Nepal on 13 January to visit the Pashupatinath temple, a grand shrine on the outskirts of Kathmandu which is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.The trip was reportedly Jaiswal's idea - a father of three, he wanted to pray at the temple for another son.They planned to go paragliding in Pokhara. Jaiswal was livestreaming as the plane came in to land.Several villagers remembered the four men as \"kind, fun-loving souls\". Anju Khatiwada was co-piloting Yeti Airlines flight 691. A trailblazer, Anju was one of just six women employed by the airline as pilots and had flown close to 6,400 hours. \"She was a full captain at the airline who had done solo flights,\" Sudarshan Bartaula from Yeti Airlines said. \"She was a brave woman.\"It has emerged that her husband Dipak Pokhrel had also been co-piloting a Yeti Airlines flight when it crashed in 2006 - and it was his death that spurred Anju to pursue a career in aviation.Nira was a singer who often flew with Yeti Airlines. Low-cost air travel has become an affordable and popular way for Nepal's middle class to traverse the mountainous nation. Nira, who had moved to Kathmandu, had been on the flight on her way to perform at a music festival in Pokhara. \"She was a very talented artist and used to sing folk songs. She would often sing spontaneously,\" her friend Bhimsen told the BBC. \"I have no words to describe the loss.\"Ruan Calum Crighton, 34, from Essex in the United Kingdom, was a professional ballet dancer who had studied and worked in London and Europe.Former colleagues remember a \"wonderful\" man.Ruan's name and passport number was published by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal shortly after the crash. It listed his nationality as Irish, but he was later confirmed to have been travelling on a UK passport.

Yet the stream of headlines has been widely discussed in this former British colony.My mother, who rarely reads any British newspapers, seems to have more details of the saga than I do - and plenty of other alleged insider information. Nigerian WhatsApp groups are a notorious breeding ground for fake and outlandish news.From the headlines we have seen so far, Africa has come up a number of times in Harry's and Meghan's stories. The couple talked lovingly to Netflix about their Zimbabwean nanny and how they allowed her to carry their son Archie on her back, tying him with a cloth, which is commonplace in many African countries.Harry revealed in the documentary that they had wanted to move to South Africa but scrapped that plan after it was leaked to the media.The prince has been particularly involved in Lesotho, which is surrounded by South Africa and where he first went as a 19-year-old and continued to visit regularly - becoming friends with Prince Seeiso.Together they set up a charity in 2006 to help vulnerable children, especially those affected by the HIV epidemic.\"Lesotho gave me the space and the freedom to breathe, to live and to grow. I've got a second family out there and a group of friends that literally brought me up,\" he told Netflix.In his book he also described a later dispute with his older brother William over who should own the Africa charity brief.They are both passionate about nature conservation on the continent and Prince William is patron of the wildlife charity Tusk Trust.\"Africa is my thing, you can't have it,\" Harry says William told him in what could be considered a modern-day scramble for Africa.Yet neither this sibling rivalry nor other mentions of the continent seem to have garnered as much interest amongst Nigerians as Harry's description in Spare of an incident in 1999 with a leopard in Botswana, which he interpreted as a message from his mother, the late Princess Diana.He took a step towards the leopard, which had come into their safari camp one evening, until some aides grabbed him away.\"I thought of my mother. That leopard was, without a doubt, a signal sent by her,\" Harry wrote.He separately described consulting a medium, who also gave him a message from his mother. \"You're living the life she couldn't. You're living the life she wanted for you,\" the unnamed woman told him.However, the narrative going viral in Nigeria seems to have conflated the two incidents, giving the impression that Harry consulted a medium in Africa.This fake news story has generated quite a bit of amusement here, based on the stereotype of Africa and our penchant for the supernatural.Nigeria's hugely successful movie industry, known as Nollywood, often produces films featuring people consulting traditional priests who claim the ability to see into the past, future and the world of the dead. But while the drama has been a source of intrigue and comedy, many Nigerians find the entire situation heart-breaking, and continue to express hope of a royal family reconciliation. Nigerian cultures differ and individuals do not all share the same thoughts and attitudes, but we are generally a family-focused people. Family bonds are one of our core values.Many of us have parents from polygamous homes, and vast extended families, where drama is rarely lacking.The Nigerian way to deal with this is to call a family forum - with the presence of many relatives - to resolve the major conflicts that arise. All sides are invited to present their case and air their grievances in the presence of respected family members, including supporters of each opposing party.The atmosphere can get heated, fingers pointed in faces and punches attempted or thrown. Family members present are usually on standby to ensure that these bust-ups do not get out of hand.Growing up, I watched my father mediate over family issues in his role as the first son of his late father, who had three wives and more than 20 children.In more recent years when my father became the oldest member and therefore head of the entire Nwaubani clan, I have watched his role of mediator expand to cover more families, in disputes from those between siblings or cousins, to couples or in-laws.By the time each party has said their say to their fill, it often becomes clear that recollections really can vary, as well as perspectives and interpretations. You could go into one of these meetings convinced that a woman is a selfish spendthrift, and come out convinced instead that her husband is a tight-fisted tyrant. Even if a resolution satisfactory to both parties is not reached, everyone at least goes away fully aware of the intricacies of the issue - and not from a third party, like the media.Perhaps this kind of African family meeting could help the British monarchy at this difficult time?Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica","Description":"In our series of letters from African journalists, writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at what Nigerians have been making of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's latest revelations - especially Prince Harry's encounter with a leopard.

The national stoppages involve transport, school and health workers. P\u0026O did release an optimised schedule, but said it could not anticipate the extent of disruption to services, adding that \"it is possible that our wider operations could be affected during the day\".The company said it hopes to resume services from Dover to Calais later this afternoon.There will be a shuttle service between Dover and Calais until all traffic is cleared.

Irish Ferries said that while crossings from Calais are affected, drivers with freight are still able to access that port and \"check-in as normal\". The strike is affecting Eurostar rail services - a reduced number of trains is running due to staff shortages. There are cancellations between London and Paris and on services connecting London to Lille, Brussels, Rotterdam and Amsterdam.There will also be a reduced Eurostar service on Friday. In France, the action affects much more than the ferries. Watch: Protesters held flares and played drums in strikes across FranceIntercity and commuter train services are badly disrupted. Many schools and other public services are shut. At Orly airport in Paris, one-in-five flights has been cancelled.On the Paris metro only the two driverless lines are working normally. Large demonstrations are being staged in Paris and other major cities. Dover was the scene of lengthy queues last July for travellers heading for the port and the Eurotunnel terminal. UK and French officials could not agree on the cause of the disruption - some UK critics blamed a lack of French border staff but some French politicians said extra checks post-Brexit and a lack of capacity at the port were behind the delays.

Now there is one in the UK. But what's the appeal? The BBC's James Landale joined the new sauna society inside Finland's embassy in London to find out how it works. Diplomacy can come in many forms; international summits, high level negotiations, and smart receptions where people sip champagne and eat fancy chocolates. But diplomats from Finland have what they say is a secret weapon, a unique way of engaging with people - just so long as they are ready to take their clothes off. For years, there has been a diplomatic sauna society in the Finnish embassy in Washington DC, as well as others around the world. And now there is also one in the basement of the embassy in London, after it opened last year. The format for \"sauna diplomacy\" is simple. Finnish diplomats invite their contacts to the UK embassy. Introductions are made, a drink is had, and then it's time to gets changed. The women head off to the sauna by themselves. When they are done, the men have their turn. At the end, everyone gathers for another drink and a small bite to eat. Call it naked networking. And apparently it works.\"Sauna is an old Finnish tradition, an integral part of Finnish way of life,\" says Heli Suominen, press counsellor at UK's Finnish embassy. Sauna diplomacy, she says, is all about building trust and forging friendships. \"It creates a good ambience for having frank discussions. The fact that you're not fully dressed helps because everyone is equal, it's easier to forget your roles and titles. So you can actually go to the bottom of things.\" Which is one way of putting it. The idea is that getting hot and sweaty relaxes all sides, builds trust and reduces tensions, making it easier to build relationships. And that is exactly how it was when I took part in an evening of sauna diplomacy in London. There are clear rules. You shower first, you wear swimwear or a towel, and men sweat with men, women with women. As you enter, you get what is called a \"bum towel\" to sit on for protection against the heat. The thermometer in my sauna said the temperature was about 80C. And so you then sweat and chat. Very quickly barriers are broken down. Sauna diplomacy does not work in all countries - some cultures are less accustomed to near-nudity in public - and there is something very intimate about being squeezed into a small, dimly lit space with five other men. But when I asked if anyone felt uncomfortable, no-one said yes. Federico Bianchi, a diplomat currently working for the European Union in London, says he enjoyed it because it was so different - engaging in diplomacy without the usual tools of his trade: a sharp suit and a mobile phone. \"It is quite peculiar not to be clothed and not to be able to rely also on your look and the perception that you think your counterpart can have of you,\" Bianchi offers. \"You just have to rely on the naked words, and what you say.\"There have been times when Finnish leaders used the sauna for more direct diplomacy. In the 1960s, Finland's Cold War leader - Urho Kekkonen - took the then President of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev into an all-night sauna and persuaded him to allow Finland to integrate with the West. In 2005, when Vladimir Putin visited Helsinki, he had a sauna with the husband of the Finnish president, Tarja Halonen, and described it as \"a wonderful experience\". But these days sauna diplomacy is more about cultural engagement. Sanna Kangasharju, a Finnish diplomat currently working for the European Parliament, used to run the sauna society in Washington DC.\"It was hugely popular,\" she says. \"It became a kind of underground thing and everybody wanted to have the ticket to the sauna society. Every country has an embassy in Washington - we were all fighting for the attention of the reporters, [and] people working in Congress. And once you created something where it was a little bit difficult to get - we could invite only 25 people once a month on a Friday evening - you wanted to have that ticket.\"Sanna feels she would not have developed such a strong network in the US capital without the sauna. \"They want a special experience,\" she says. \"When you go to a reception and you meet other people, you can say: 'Oh, I didn't recognise you with your clothes on'. You want to be a part of that club.\"The elephant in the sauna for many will, of course, be sex. In some cultures, the two are linked. But not, says Heli, in Finland. \"Finnish sauna is very decidedly a non-sexual space, even more than other places where you meet people,\" she explains. \"It's almost sacred to us that it's a safe space for everyone. The point of sauna is that everyone feels comfortable and respected.\"Some diplomacy can involve eating and drinking too much. It can also involve long hours of work. But after an evening of sauna diplomacy we felt good, the strains of the day sweated into the night. We left with a certificate declaring our membership of the Diplomatic Sauna Society. Its motto: \"All people are created equal, but nowhere more so than in a sauna.\"","Description":"Finnish diplomats have used saunas as a relaxed venue for discussing international policies and solving problems for years.

Stroll the streets of the capital Zagreb, and even in the winter months you will find the pavement cafés crowded with cappuccino-quaffing locals.But early in the New Year, some have been finding that their favourite beverage now comes with a bitter aftertaste. Croatia adopted the euro as its currency on 1 January, a decade after it became the European Union's newest - and still most recent - member.And the switch from the kuna has left many Croatians convinced that cafés, as well as retailers and service providers, are taking advantage by hiking their prices. The local media has been full of gripes about price-gouging since the start of the year. And a straw poll of punters in Zagreb's main square confirms the consternation. \"It's very confusing,\" says Vina as her friends Monika and Tonka nod in agreement. \"It looks cheaper but it's actually really expensive. We just paid six euros for two coffees and a cola - I was shocked.\"Another local, Zivana, feels much the same way. \"All these price rises started in June,\" she says. \"Now it's in the spotlight and it's even worse. We're not happy with the government and the way they've handled the situation.\" The controversy has been raging so fiercely that Croatia's government felt it had to intervene. It called retailers into meetings to warn them that it would not tolerate unjustified price hikes. The businesses declared themselves outraged by the government besmirching their reputation.But the authorities clearly felt they could not afford to have the euro become synonymous with stealthy profiteering. The government ordered retailers to ensure prices were no higher than their level on 31 December. State inspectors pounced on transgressors, filing cases against almost 200 recalcitrant retailers in the space of a week. There are, of course, those who feel that the great Croatian coffee controversy is just so much froth. As he works the espresso machine in a bar on Zagreb's bustling Flower Square, barman Luka says he suspects that people are getting steamed up over nothing.\"We had our prices displayed in euro before the euro came in,\" he says. \"Now they say we're too expensive - but it's the same price as it was before the New Year.\"With all the noise about price hikes - whether real or imagined - it would be easy to forget why Croatia chose to join the eurozone. In fact, it was committed to membership of the single currency as a condition of joining the EU in 2013.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade.Other member states have shown that commitment is one thing, but actually adopting the euro is another matter entirely. Croatia's neighbour Hungary originally had a plan to scrap the forint in 2007. But 16 years later, it remains firmly outside the eurozone. Poland, Romania, Sweden and the Czech Republic are all theoretically obliged to adopt the euro. But none have plans to do so. Only Bulgaria seems set to join the single currency in 2024. It makes Croatia's determination to meet the euro's convergence criteria seem all the more impressive. It reflects the stability of numerous factors - inflation in the country, the government's budget deficit, the nation's debt-to-GDP ratio, and its long-term interest rates since joining the EU.Exchange rate stability was virtually a given, bearing in mind that on the creation of its national currency in 1994, Croatia pegged the kuna to the Deutsche mark. A euro peg followed in 2002. The governor of Croatia's National Bank, Boris Vujcic, says all this meant that his country, its businesses and its people were exceedingly well prepared for the adoption of the single currency. \"Croatia was already heavily euroised,\" notes Mr Vujcic. \"Corporate, government and household debts were already denominated in euros or linked to euros. Now all the income is in the same currency as the debts.\"Far from causing price increases, Croatia's chief banker believes that committing to the single currency spared the country from the worst of the inflation that has struck countries outside the eurozone over the past year. \"You can see the impact of the crisis was much less severe in Croatia's case, because markets already priced in the fact that we were getting into the eurozone,\" says Mr Vujcic.Now Croatian businesses are looking forward to a boost from the euro, combined with the fact that the adoption of the single currency has coincided with Croatia's membership of the borderless Schengen Area.The latter makes life significantly easier for European tourists arriving in the country by car or coach, as they will no longer have to face interminable queues at border crossings. And euro adoption means visitors won't have to dice with dodgy exchange rates at a hole-in-the-wall bureau de change.As a result, Croatia's tourism industry, which contributes around a fifth of Croatia's GDP, is expected to get a boost.Dubravko Miholic, an adviser to the Croatian National Tourist Board, has been following comments on travel websites in the countries that send the most holidaymakers, such as Germany and Austria. \"They're saying it's great, finally we won't need to change money,\" he says.The experts also predict a boon for Croatia's exporters, with the single currency eliminating the last remaining source of friction in cross-border trade within the EU.\"In less than a decade of EU membership, we've seen the export of goods more than double,\" says Goran Saravanja, chief economist of the Croatian Chamber of Commerce. \"Now, companies outside the euro area who are thinking of locating in Europe are looking at 20 countries, rather than 19.\"We're already good at logistics because of our geography. Now without the additional costs, thanks to Schengen and the euro, there's an impetus there.\"If the predictions are correct, the benefits should become clear in the next few years. But for now Croatian consumers remain more concerned about taking a hit to the pocket as they get used to carrying the new currency.They can no longer spend the kuna. But retailers must still display prices in old money until the end of the year, to reassure customers that while the denomination may have changed, the value remains the same.","Description":"Only the very brave - or the very foolish - would dare to come between a Croatian and their coffee.

It warned hikers to \"stay away\" from that area. \"It is extremely dangerous and even experienced hikers are getting in trouble,\" the department said. They are also searching for another hiker, an American, who went missing in the same mountains.Last week, a mother of four whom friends described as an experienced hiker died after sliding more than 500ft down Mount Baldy. Mr Sands was reported missing at about 19:30 local time on Friday 13 January.The department's search and rescue crews responded and began a search, but this was hampered by severe weather warnings and trail conditions.\"However, we continue to search by helicopter and drones when the weather permits,\" the statement said.Mr Sands has talked in the past about his love of hiking and mountain climbing. When asked in a Guardian interview in 2020 what made him happy, he replied: \"Close to a mountain summit on a glorious cold morning.\"Born in Yorkshire, Mr Sands has appeared in dozens of films and TV shows, but it was a lead role in the 1985 British romance A Room With A View that brought him global fame.The father of three most recently appeared in the drama Benediction, which also starred Peter Capaldi.Mr Sands lives in the North Hollywood neighbourhood of Los Angeles with his wife, writer Evgenia Citkowitz. They have two children.He was previously married to Sarah Sands, former editor of BBC Radio 4's Today programme, with whom he has a son.","Description":"British actor Julian Sands has been reported missing after going hiking in mountains north of Los Angeles.

After taking a DNA test, he discovered his birth father, Johnny Zielinski, was stationed near Wimborne, Dorset, during World War Two where he met his mother.He has now met his birth father's family in Monterey, California.Mr Barrett, 77, of Wickham, was 17 when he first questioned his mother about who his biological father was.\"The only thing she really would say was his name, Johnny Zielinski,\" he said. \"When I tried to probe she would just well up and would not discuss it at all.\"Mr Barrett got on with his life and said it was only when his wife suggested doing some research to find out about his father that he decided to take a DNA test. It revealed his genetic heritage as 50% Polish and a computer search for blood relatives showed the Zielinski family from California as having a strong DNA match. They received the information at the same time. He then discovered his mother met the American in October 1944 at a dance in Wimborne, and Mr Barrett was born the following year.\"There was obviously a liaison that took place, which isn't surprising bearing in mind we're five years into a war,\" Mr Barrett said.\"He went off to fight shortly after without knowing that I was even conceived.\"Mr Zielinski, who was injured in the final year of the war and unable to have further children, died in 2014 without knowing he had a son.

Since 1960, politicians have moved to raise, extend or revise the definition of the debt limit 78 times - including three just in the last six months. But fresh tensions in Congress, where Republicans recently took control of the House of Representatives and are calling for spending cuts, have raised concerns that politicians will delay acting this time - potentially leading the US to intentionally default for the first time in its history.  So what would happen?For most of us, the impact should be barely noticeable - at least in the first few months. The US Treasury can manage the situation by taking what are dubbed \"extraordinary\" measures to avoid actually breaching the limit. In the past, this has included steps such as suspending investments it is supposed to make into retirement and health benefit funds for federal employees - then re-topping those funds at a later date.But even delays do have a real price. The stand-off on the issue in 2011 prompted the S\u0026P credit ratings agency to downgrade the country's rating - a first for the US. Government analysts have estimated that delays that year caused the cost of borrowing for the US Treasury to increase by at least $1.3bn, as investors demanded higher rates due to the uncertainty. Analysts are already expecting debate on the issue this year to make financial markets jumpy. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has estimated that special measures can buy time for the US until at least June, at which point the government will no longer be able to pay its bills.That is the scenario many analysts see as a true economic catastrophe.In the event, some say authorities would have to do as much as they can to avoid default. That would mean finding ways to make interest payments while other obligations go unpaid, such as defence contractor payments; Social Security cheques, received by retirees across the country; and salaries of government employees, including the military. Even something as basic as weather forecasts could be affected, since so many rely on data from the government-funded National Weather Service. A default could ruin the country's trustworthiness, roiling global financial markets, where US debt is heavily traded and has traditionally been viewed as low risk. The dollar would weaken and borrowing costs would spike - at first for the government but ultimately for the broader public, in the form of higher interest rates for mortgages, credit card debt and other loans. Getting to that point would be unprecedented, and cause widespread damage to consumer confidence and the economy, which is already in a precarious state.\"Failure to meet the government's obligations would cause irreparable harm to the US economy, the livelihoods of all Americans and global financial stability\" Ms Yellen warned recently. The debt limit was first introduced in 1917, as a way to give the government flexibility to raise money during the First World War. In theory it gives Congress a way to check in on spending.But fights over the ceiling have become increasingly fractious, as political polarisation increases and US debt has skyrocketed, roughly doubling in a decade. That is due in part to major government spending during the financial crisis and the pandemic - but it is also a reflection of the fact that the country has consistently run a budget deficit - spent more than it raised - every year since 2001.Now, the debt ceiling is a perennial political bargaining chip.The 2011 fight over the debt limit was resolved when then-President Barack Obama agreed to spending cuts worth more than $900bn - and the debt limit was lifted by a similar amount.Some Republicans are pushing for spending cuts again this time - a position that Democrats have rejected.","Description":"The US is, once again, poised to run up against the country's debt limit.

AK Saseendran, wildlife minister in Kerala, was reported as saying that his government may consider solutions including sterilisation or culling to check tiger numbers in the state.He was speaking amid outrage over the death of a farmer in a tiger attack. The minister later told the BBC he only repeated a suggestion from locals regarding culling tigers.By then, his comments had set off a discussion on wildlife conservation, with several experts expressing outrage and pointing out that culling was a \"legally untenable\" suggestion.India is home to more than 70% of the world's tigers - according to the most recent government estimate, the numbers stand at 2,976. But their habitats haven't expanded at the same rate, forcing so-called \"surplus\" tigers to move outside protected reserves and come in conflict with humans.A federal wildlife protection law, implemented in 1972, makes it virtually illegal to kill or capture tigers - designated India's national animal - even when they are involved in such conflicts. The attack in Kerala took place on 13 January in the Mananthavady forest range in Wayanad district. The victim, 50, sustained serious injuries to his hands and legs and died of a cardiac arrest while being transferred from one hospital to another. A medical report said that his wounds had caused \"excessive bleeding\".After his death, angry locals protested against forest officials and demanded that the tiger be killed.Local media reported that Mr Saseendran had mooted culling as a possible solution to the issue.But the minister told the BBC that the suggestion on culling came from locals who had attended a meeting with all the political parties to discuss a way out.\"We have to find a solution to control the animals... I am not in a hurry to cull,\" he said.Dr Ullas Karanth, a conservationist and tiger expert, told the BBC that over the past 50 years, the population of tigers had only increased by a thousand, far less than capacity.  \"So the suggestion to cull tigers to reduce their numbers is not a sound idea,\" he says.Praveen Bhargav, a former member of the National Board for Wildlife, said that a recently amended section of the national Wildlife Act does not permit declaration of tigers \"as vermin\". \"The proposal of the forest minister is legally not tenable,\" Bhargav said.There is, however, a provision in the law \"in case of serious human-wildlife conflict\", where a state's chief wildlife warden can allow a tiger to be hunted \"after being satisfied that it cannot be tranquilised or translocated\", he added.Dr Karanth said that sometimes problems do arise in a few tiger habitats where there is a high density of the animals.\"But in 90% of tiger forests there is no such problem. In large parts of eastern and north-east India, tigers are virtually extinct because of excessive hunting of prey and tigers. We should not lose sight of this basic fact,\" he says.If tigers enter human habitats and prey on livestock, authorities should immediately pay compensation, he says. And if they become man-eaters, they should be \"immediately killed\", Dr Karanth adds, calling it \"damage control in specific instances\".But the suggestion to cull tigers found some support from reputed environmentalist Madhav Gadgil, who told The New Indian Express newspaper that India should allow \"rational hunting\" of animals to check their numbers.\"India is the lone country having legislation for protecting wild animals. I think it is irrational, foolish, unconstitutional and nothing to be proud of. No other country protects wild animals outside of its national parks,\" Mr Gadgil said, according to the report.How the Indian government launched ‘Project Tiger’ to save the animals from extinction","Description":"An Indian state minister's comments on culling tigers has sparked a debate on conservation.

Add sex, drugs and murder to the mix and Banerjee's story becomes the stuff of sensational legend.In India, Banerjee - and his work - is hardly known. In the US, the Chippendales brand appears to have eclipsed the reputation of its controversial founder. That is now changing.Nearly three decades after his death, a podcast and a host of TV shows - including Hulu's latest drama series Welcome To Chippendales, starring Kumail Nanjiani - are revisiting Banerjee's story.\"Most people would think that the founder of Chippendales was an outgoing party animal who chased women, did drugs, and drank heavily,\" says Scott MacDonald, co-author of the 2014 book Deadly Dance: The Chippendales Murders. \"Steve was a reserved, controlled man with a clear goal of creating a worldwide brand to rival Disney, Playboy or Polo.\"He is \"a unique part of the story\", says historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, whose podcast, Welcome to Your Fantasy, renewed interest in the Chippendales legacy. Bespectacled, brown and stocky, Banerjee stood in contrast to the \"white, blonde, California man\" fantasy sold by his franchise.If you're watching the Hulu series, the rest of this story may contain spoilersBanerjee, who hailed from a family of printers, left India for Canada as a 20-something man in the late 1960s. He soon ended up in California, where he owned a gas station in Los Angeles. Banerjee, however, had bigger ambitions. \"I want to be driving that car,\" he would say when people drove up to fill up their fancy vehicles, Petrzela says.In the 1970s, Banerjee used his savings to buy a dive bar in LA which he called Destiny II, and tried everything to draw in crowds - backgammon games, magic shows and mud wrestling among women.In 1979, Paul Snider, a nightclub promoter, suggested that Banerjee bring in male strippers - usually only seen in gay clubs - for a show aimed at women.By now, the bar had been renamed Chippendales to suggest a classier experience. The strip shows were advertised all across West LA - everywhere women gathered, from nail salons to women's restrooms, Petrzela says on her podcast.An instant hit, Chippendales soon drew large crowds of women every night. Inspired by Hugh Hefner's Playboy bunnies, the dancers wore cuffs and collars with tight black pants.For 1980s America \"this was shocking\", Petrzela says. But in the wake of the sexual revolution of the 1970s, Banerjee's Chippendales also came at a time when women's empowerment and sexual liberation could be commodified, the historian explains.Women needed a place \"they could have a blast and be exonerated\", Barbara Ligeti, a club promoter, says in the A\u0026E docu-series Secrets of the Chippendales Murders. \"They could see each other, have a few drinks, pinch a butt, put $20 in a G-string of a good-looking guy.\"Banerjee wanted to create a \"Disneyland for adults\", a brand big enough to rival those of his heroes - Hefner and Walt Disney.In the early 80s, he met Nick De Noia, an Emmy Award-winning director and choreographer, who convinced him that the show needed an upgrade. Chippendales dancers and producers credit De Noia with turning the show into an interactive, theatrical production using characters and storylines.De Noia helped take Chippendales to New York City and expand the production across America through a successful tour. But things soon came to a head between the two men as the charismatic choreographer became the face of the brand - dubbed \"Mr Chippendale\" in the media - while Banerjee remained in the background, running the operation from LA.As tensions rose, De Noia and Banerjee dissolved their partnership and the choreographer planned to start his own company - US Male. In the docu-series, a former associate producer at Chippendales who helped De Noia with his new venture says it sent Banerjee \"over the edge\".Many who knew Banerjee described him as a \"paranoid\" man for whom success was a zero-sum game. \"He felt if others succeeded, that would necessarily take away from his own success,\" Petrzela says.As rival strip clubs popped up, Banerjee hired Ray Colon, a friend-turned-hitman, to sabotage competitors. In 1987, under Banerjee's orders, Colon recruited an accomplice who shot De Noia dead in his office. While friends and collaborators suspected Banerjee's hand in the crime, it was years before FBI investigators made the link.Banerjee's lawyer Bruce Nahin said \"the murder didn't affect the brand at all\".Chippendales grew, travelling to Australia and Europe.In 1991, while in the UK with the Chippendales tour, Banerjee asked Colon to take out members of a rival troupe started by former dancers from his club. According to FBI evidence, the plan was to inject them with cyanide which Colon provided to an accomplice named Strawberry.But an apprehensive Strawberry reported Colon to the FBI.Colon was arrested and charged with conspiracy and murder for hire. According to the agency, 46 grams of cyanide were found during a raid on Colon's house.For months after his arrest, Colon remained loyal to Banerjee, pleading not guilty. \"It was only after Steve refused to help him by paying for an attorney that Ray finally broke with Steve,\" MacDonald says. In 1993, the FBI finally gathered enough evidence against Banerjee by using Colon to secretly record their conversation. Banerjee was arrested for racketeering, conspiracy and murder for hire among other charges. He pleaded not guilty. After the trial went on for a few months, Banerjee agreed to a plea deal - 26 years in prison and forfeiture of Chippendales ownership to the US government. Petrzela says Banerjee's lawyers tried hard to avoid the seizure of the enterprise, but to no avail. In October 1994, a day before he was to be sentenced, Banerjee killed himself in his jail cell.\"Very few Indian Americans know his story,\" says Anirvan Chatterjee, who organises a South Asian radical history walking tour in Berkeley. Banerjee's life was \"the funhouse mirror version of the standard 1990s Indian California business story\", he says, and it contradicted every stereotype about the community.In her research, Petrzela found Banerjee had tried hard to assimilate and become a true-blue California businessman, yet in the memory of her interviewees his Indian accent stood out. \"It's clear other people always saw him as very foreign and very Indian,\" she says. \"Even in death, the first thing that people did when commenting on him is start imitating his accent.\"Photographing America's strip clubs","Description":"Muscled men wearing bow-ties and G-strings to entertain women in smoky clubs is not a legacy one usually associates with an Indian-American immigrant.

Argentine player Sala, 28, was on a private flight from Nantes as he travelled to take up his new role with the club then in the Premier League.But the club have been unable to claim back the money paid for Sala after insurers refused to pay out.Cardiff City FC is suing insurance broker Miller Insurance LLP claiming it owes more than £10m in a High Court bid.The club says the firm failed to say players would not be covered if they were not \"timely informed\" of new signings such as their new star striker.But lawyers representing the brokers say it was not up to them to \"chase\" club bosses over making sure new signings were insured and that the club were \"fully aware\" Sala was not insured.Alistair Schaff KC told the High Court that Cardiff City contacted insurers regarding Sala on 22 January 2019, the morning after his flight went missing off the coast of Alderney.Mr Schaff said the club made contact via email seeking £20m coverage for Sala.Cardiff City claim says Miller Insurance failed to properly explain the concept of an \"insurable interest\" for football player transfers and the requirement of a \"prompt\" notification of the transfer in order to secure coverage.It said the broker also did not let the club know about the risks of \"delaying this notification of an interest or the steps that might be taken to reduce or eliminate the risks\".Emiliano Sala: Catalogue of errors led to plane crashBut Miller insisted it was not their responsibility to chase the club to ensure that it added new players to its policy \"immediately\".It claimed the broker had warned Cardiff City Football Club several times that there would be a gap in a player's insurance cover between acquiring an \"insurable interest\" in a new player and informing the insurer.Lawyers for Cardiff City said that Miller's defence is being \"evaluated, but doesn't seem to contain any surprises\".The club, represented by David Phillips KC, added that it expects to file a reply \"soon\" to the High Court.","Description":"Cardiff City tried to take out £20m insurance on Emiliano Sala the day after he was killed in a plane crash, say papers filed to the High Court.

Thursday is the first day of action by the Unite union and follows two days of GMB walkouts.Unite wants a cost of living salary rise and said a Welsh government offer of a one-off payment would not stop strike action.Health Minister Eluned Morgan said \"the clock is ticking\" on the time the unions have to accept that offer.It comes as new figures show the Welsh Ambulance Service received a record number of calls in December, with response times at a record low. Ministers have said they understood workers' frustrations and called on people to minimise pressure on the NHS.Unite, which represents about a quarter of Wales' ambulance workers, said it will provide so-called \"life and limb\" emergency care but wants talks to move faster. Tace Richards, a paramedic on the picket line in Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said: \"We want to do our best, we've worked through the pandemic, we've had all the claps on a Thursday night. [But] they do not put food on the table for our children and families\". He said more money would encourage more staff to come back to the NHS, meaning better conditions for patients. \"Westminster needs to sort this issue out, the fact they are completely refusing to talk with us, they would rather pass legislation to stop us striking,\" he said. Catherine Sutton, a dispatch assistant on the picket line in Bangor, said she was striking because change is needed.She said: \"We've had a real terms pay cut for the last two years, people are struggling, the pressures the NHS are under... it's just too much.\"There's people leaving the service in droves. We need to up the incentives for the staff to stay.\"Addressing people's concern's about patient safety during the strikes, Ms Sutton emphasised that this was an issue outside of the strikes as well and was one of the main reasons she was out on the picket line. \"You go into work and you've got sixty to seventy people waiting for an ambulance and no one to send, so that's why we're here.\"Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said NHS staffing problems were making her members' jobs increasingly difficult. She said: \"They see first-hand how our NHS is collapsing. A decent consolidated pay increase is the only way to improve NHS recruitment and relieve the crippling pressure on our ambulance services.\"The recent proposal from the Welsh government of a one-off payment simply does not cut it.\"She said the only way to prevent further strikes was for the Welsh government to offer a cost of living salary increase.Zoe Codd, regional officer for Unite the Union, said from the picket line at Glangwili Hospital, Carmarthen: \"I think speaking to the members today, it's very clear that they are frustrated at the fact they spend most of their shift outside A\u0026E departments.\"They know the number of calls coming in from patients in our communities that need help, but they're stuck outside the hospitals because they've got patients that can't get into A\u0026E. \"That's not acceptable, that's not their job. Their job is to be supporting patients so we need to really fix that issue and be providing the care to people in communities that really need it.\"Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Jason Killens, Chief Executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service said staff have described \"a deep conflict in the choices they are making\".\"On the one hand - like me - I joined the ambulance service to help people and provide great care to patients when they need it most.\"yet when I've been speaking to colleagues, they say they feel so strongly that they can't do that on a day to day basis because of the pressure, that they feel they need to take action,\" he said. Unite has a second 24-hour strike planned for Monday, 23 January. Ambulance crews, control-room staff and others in Wales are picketing, and next week colleagues in England will also take action.Pressure is increasing on the Welsh and UK governments, with NHS unions planning to take further action next month. The GMB has unveiled fresh strikes in February and March. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Eluned Morgan said: \"We're still talking to the trade unions on this matter, we haven't averted strike action yet, but the clock is ticking.\"This is a payment that has to go out before the end of February if it's going to be paid at all, and I think that would go a long way to helping some people who are struggling in the NHS.\"\"We have put a package of measures on the table that we hope in time will lead to unions calling off strikes.\"We have put a non-consolidated award on the table to be discussed with the unions,\" she said. The first, on 6 February, will coincide with a walkout by thousands of nurses from the Royal College of Nursing.The Welsh government said it understood the anger of public sector workers.\"We will continue to work with the NHS, unions and partners to ensure life-saving and life-maintaining care is provided during the industrial action, patient safety is maintained and disruption is minimised,\" a spokesman said.Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the Welsh government needed to stop \"blaming UK ministers for failing in its own responsibilities\".  \"Patients cannot be allowed to suffer with our public services at a standstill and staff cannot be expected to burn out because Labour ministers cannot get their act together,\" he said.Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said a \"substantive\" pay rise had to be built into health workers' salaries.\"It's up to government now to avert future strikes by putting a deal on the table that can put the NHS on a firmer foundation for the future,\" he said.Do you work for an ambulance service?

Tourists will be coming from all over the world as it's very well preserved.\"It is thought the 30 metre (98ft), 400 tonne, medium-sized boat was having a refit following a voyage from the Iberian Peninsula to Bristol.This was taking place in a River Usk inlet in 1468 or 1469 when its moorings broke.Much of the oak planks and iron were stripped before the tide hid the stricken remains, with a third of the vessel succumbing to its muddy grave - lying untouched for more than five centuries.Economic impact assessments predict the preserved boat could attract up to 150,000 visitors a year - making it one of Wales' most popular tourist attractions - and boost the south Wales economy by £7m a year.Archaeologists plan to allow the public in to watch them reassemble the remains when a venue big enough is secured to take the boat.\"You cannot build this thing then move it,\" added Mr Jones. \"You can only build it in its final position, but when it is done, it will be stable and has the potential for being on display in perpetuity.\"Newport council, who have led conservation work, will soon start a feasibility study to look at where best to house the ship - with an empty department store a possibility.\"We're keen to find a home which maximises accessibility for everybody as we want to share this great treasure,\" said Newport council leader Jane Mudd.\"The potential economic benefits are important too - and as more than 1,000 people attend talks on the Newport Ship, it indicates there is huge interest.\"","Description":"Newport's medieval ship has become one of Wales' biggest historical findsWith almost 2,500 pieces, measuring 30 metres and weighing 25 tonnes, it has been called the world's largest 3D puzzle. Archaeologists can now, after 20 years of painstaking restoration, start to reassemble the wreck of a 15th Century ship found in a south Wales riverbank. \"We have a massive, flat-pack ship that we need to reassemble and there are no instructions,\" said the project's curator Toby Jones. \"There are archaeological ships on display around the world but nothing from the period of the 15th Century so this is what makes this so significant and special. Now historians say the Newport Ship will be the only 15th Century maritime exhibit on show anywhere in the world. The team made their final visit to England's south coast on Thursday to pick up the last batch of about 100 timbers and return them to Newport, ensuring they are all under one roof again for the first time in years.

A tougher approach to disciplinary matters was promised by the PSNI a number of months ago.Last September, launching its first action plan aimed at tackling violence against women and girls, it said the \"very highest professional standards\" were required to build public trust and confidence in policing.Supt Claire McGuigan, of the PSNI professional standards department, said: \"The chief constable's message is clear. \"Just as we will pursue perpetrators of violence against women and girls in our communities, we are committed to rooting out those that may be in our own ranks.\"Questioned on the BBC's Talkback programme, Ms McGuigan, revealed that concern over \"access to public protection weapons\" was a feature of some of the current misconduct investigations, but she said she could not discuss the detail of individual cases.She accepted that policing \"has taken a battering\" since Sarah Everard's murder in London and more recently again this week with the conviction of David Carrick.\"In terms of these [PSNI] figures, I'm sure this is quite alarming for people. I'm alarmed by it, my colleagues are alarmed by it,\" Ms McGuigan said. But she added that the PSNI had also seen \"increased reporting\" of misconduct claims since the PSNI appealed to victims to come forward so allegations could be investigated. \"I hope that demonstrates that people are confident, they've responded. We're investigating and we're being robust,\" she said.\"We're dealing with these people and we're dealing with them in the most robust way.\"However, there is concern over the number of officers facing domestic and sexual abuse allegations and how the issue has been dealt with to date. \"I'm disappointed that they are talking about taking it seriously now. They should have always taken it seriously,\" Marie Brown, the director of Foyle's Women's Aid, said. \"We're in a time where they know enough about the damage that sexual abuse and sexual crime has on victims.\"I'm just wondering about the governance and how this was allowed to go on for so long.\"Ms Brown told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme: \"There does seem to be a culture of misogyny that needs to be addressed.\"She called for a root and branch review of the PSNI's handling of domestic and sexual abuse allegations, right back to how it recruits new staff, and continuous vetting of officers throughout their career.\"I'm disappointed for all the good officers that I have worked with, who work really hard in this area, and I feel like they've been let down by the governance within their own organisation,\" she added. The PSNI professional standards department confirmed that officers are currently vetted during the recruitment process and then again once every 10 years, following recommendations from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary. However, Ms McGuigan said she believed those recommendations could soon change to increase the frequency of vetting. \"I've no doubt that going forward, and bearing in mind what has been in the media over the past number of days, that that will probably be reviewed and of course we will look at whether we need to do it more regularly as well,\" she told Talkback. The PSNI has been hit by a number of controversies in the past 12 months.A civilian employee, Sinead McGrotty, said she was let down by the police after making allegations of sexual assault against a serving officer.The BBC NI's Spotlight programme then exposed a group of more than 20 officers who had exchanged scores of sexist and pornographic messages on WhatsApp.The PSNI said in 2022 it held 10 misconduct hearings which had a sexual or domestic abuse dimension and as a result it dismissed nine officers.There are currently five further hearings already scheduled to be heard in coming months.The organisation has also been reviewing how it handled misconduct investigations over the past decade.Supt McGuigan added: \"The purpose is to identify any missed opportunities or areas for improvement.\"We have also published a statement of intent making it clear we will not tolerate violence, abuse, harassment or bullying of any kind.\"Where allegations are proven, dismissal will be robustly pursued.\"Last November, when the Policing Board looked at officer misconduct procedures, it asked for disciplinary processes to be carried out faster.It also urged the PSNI to make better use of its powers to dismiss officers.Recent figures have shown the number of officers dismissed from the PSNI each year - last year, there were 17 officers sacked from the PSNI in total.That compares to seven sackings in 2021; four in 2020; and three in 2019. The data shows a clear direction of travel. The question is does this indicate a tougher approach or is it simply that the PSNI is speeding up its disciplinary process?Because we know that some of these cases involve officers being suspended for a considerable period of time.","Description":"The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said it sacked nine officers last year for misconduct \"which had a sexual or domestic element\".

The reports highlight a number of areas of concern in education.For instance, they said there was still no right for pupils to withdraw themselves from collective worship in schools - like in school assemblies.Parents have the right to excuse their children from religious or collective worship but \"no action has been taken to permit pupils to withdraw from compulsory worship\", said the NGO Stakeholder report.\"Unlike England and Wales, there is no right in Northern Ireland for older pupils to choose to opt out of collective worship.\"Concerns were also raised about the teaching of relationship and sex education (RSE) in schools.\"Current RSE provision is inadequate,\" the NGO Stakeholder report said.It called for the Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris to follow through on moves by his predecessor Shailesh Vara to introduce compulsory age-appropriate relationship and sex education (RSE) in schools.Currently, each school in Northern Ireland has to teach RSE but what is actually taught to pupils is a matter for each school to decide based on their school ethos.The report also found the response to the Covid-19 pandemic had increased inequalities \"with differential adverse treatment being experienced by disabled children in access to health, social care and education\".Conor Reilly, 16, from Belfast, a member of the Children's Law Centre youth panel, said there was generally a feeling among young people that \"politicians simply ignore them, that they can't communicate with them\".\"I have had opportunities to speak to politicians, yet everything I have said and my peers have said is often just ignored, at least that's what it appears to us.\" he added.\"A lot of smiles and nods, but nothing is really properly communicated.\"He told Good Morning Ulster that politicians don't seem to see the point of appealing to young people \"as we don't win elections as readily as older people\". Conor also said he would withdraw himself from collective worship at school, if given the option.\"I am not a religious young person myself, at A-levels I don't have to study RE (Religious Education) and I never had a passion for it particularly,\" he said.He added that more is needed to be done around the teaching of relationship and sex education (RSE) in schools.\"It is not just me who is feeling that, in the report we had a survey cast out to many young people - 48% of them believe that their sexual education wasn't adequate.\"I concur with that opinion - it's just not present in a lot of schools, the way it should be.\"BBC News NI has previously revealed how respite services for families were cut during the pandemic, for example.But the CLC report also highlighted wider failures in provision for children with special educational needs in the school system.It also raised concerns about how the pandemic and restrictions had affected children and young people.\"Children raised a number of concerns regarding the pandemic,\" it said.Those included: \"Impacts on the physical and emotional health of children and young people, particularly those who are vulnerable; restricted opportunities for play and leisure; negative stereotyping of young people as the main group spreading the virus.\"The pandemic also highlighted \"the significant adverse impact of lack of internet access and digital poverty\" among some disadvantaged families and in some rural areas.A previous report from the Commissioner for Children and Young People (NICCY) found children had been \"severely impacted\" by restrictions.More widely, many children and young people who contributed to the reports felt they were \"negatively stereotyped in the media\".Older teenagers especially said they faced \"discrimination and prejudice because they are viewed as being 'troublesome' or 'dangerous'\".\"Young people get categorised into stereotypes, they don't get listened to - you're just rowdy or want to fight,\" one young person told the report's authors.\"Adults look at young people and expect them to be trouble,\" another said.While a majority of young people who contributed to the reports felt that adults in their family listened to them, only around 15% of those surveyed \"considered that they would be listened to by politicians if they gave their opinion\".Fewer than one in five said that politicians asked them about \"issues that affect them or other young people in their area\".\"Politicians are just talk and no action,\" one young person told the report's authors.\"They're probably very set in their own views, there's probably more they could do - they never come into schools,\" another said.\"The UK and Northern Ireland governments exclude children from major policy decisions,\" the CLC report concluded. \"In addition to expressing a range of concerns about the implications of Brexit for travel, trade, identity, health, education, freedom of movement, security and funding, young people have argued that Brexit-related issues should be taught in schools.\"They consider that political parties and the media should publish age-appropriate literature about the implications of Brexit, and formal procedures should be established to inform children/young people as well as engaging them in debate and enabling their voices to be heard.\"The UK government has to report to UNCRC every five years on how they are protecting children's rights in Northern Ireland.The three reports submitted by the CLC on behalf of non-governmental organisations in Northern Ireland are part of the UNCRC's examination process.A delegation of young people from Northern Ireland will also travel to Geneva to meet with the UN committee in February.","Description":"Most young people in Northern Ireland do not think politicians listen to them or take their views seriously.

Chris Heaton-Harris is due to meet the Irish foreign minister in Dublin later, ahead of Thursday's deadline.He could opt to delay a poll, as he has done previously via legislation at Westminster.Currently, the latest an assembly poll can be held is 13 April 2023, meaning the government would need to announce a date for the election no later than early March.After Mr Heaton-Harris decided not to call a Stormont election before Christmas, he introduced legislation to extend the deadline for reforming a power-sharing government.It put in place two new dates: initially 8 December, with the option of a six-week extension until 19 January.That extension was exercised and the new deadline has been reached, meaning Mr Heaton-Harris faces another decision.Would he follow through with his legal duty to call a fresh election within 12 weeks, at the latest taking place on 13 April?That seems an unlikely prospect, not least because it would fall just three days after the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.Events marking the anniversary are already being planned and there is the possibility of a visit to Northern Ireland by US President Joe Biden.That is a certainty.The government previously pushed back the prospect of a poll, in order to allow London and Brussels time to make progress on resolving the dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol.The DUP has stayed out of government since February last year in protest over the protocol, which is designed to ensure free trade across the Irish land border but has led to new checks on some goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.There has in recent weeks been speculation that things are moving in the right direction, amid a UK-EU deal signed on sharing of trade data.Mr Heaton-Harris has also been involved in the latest rounds of discussions with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and EU negotiator Maroš Šefčovič.Therefore it stands to reason that the secretary of state may, if he deems it necessary, opt for the scenario that buys the UK more time, rather than pressing the nuclear button on an assembly election any time soon. There is also little appetite among the political parties in Northern Ireland to return to the polls, when they already face a local government election in May. Council elections in Northern Ireland take place every four years and the next one had been scheduled for Thursday, 4 May this year.However, those elections have been rescheduled due to a clash with King Charles III's coronation in May.The poll has been moved back by two weeks to Thursday, 18 May, with counting to begin the next day.The process can take many hours as results are determined using the proportional representation system of Single Transferable Vote (STV). We can't rule it out but for now it appears there is little chance of that.In 2014, council and European Parliament elections were held on the same day although counting of the results took place on separate days.Carrying out similar plans this May would be less than ideal for electoral staff as they would have to manage two counts concurrently.The prospect of 850 council candidates and more than 200 assembly runners canvassing at the same time could also prove challenging.Amid more dates and deadlines likely to come our way, for now all we can do is watch this space.

This beat the previous month's low of 48%, with the target being 65%. The average response time was 10 minutes in December - the slowest on record, with the average over the four years up to that month being six minutes. Figures were released on a day in which 1,000 ambulances workers were striking across Wales in a dispute over pay and conditions. Meanwhile, handover delays - the time ambulances are spending outside major A\u0026E units waiting to hand over patients - also reached record levels.A Welsh government spokesman admitted the NHS in Wales is \"still under enormous pressure\", adding data suggests December saw the busiest day on record.Opposition parties have described the situation as \"a horror show\" calling for urgent action to address the \"crisis\". There were a total of 31,319 \"lost\" hours in December - this time is counted after an ambulance spends more than 15 minutes outside emergency units. Through 2022, more than 291,345 hours were lost to handover delays.Waiting times in A\u0026E were also the worst on record with only 63.1% of people seen within the four hour target. The worst was at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, where only 43.7% were dealt with within that time in December.Those waiting more than 12 hours or more were also at record levels - and numbers passed the 12,000 mark for the first time. The target is that no patient should wait that long - on average, patients waited three hours and two minutes in A\u0026E - the third highest time on record.There are still more than 1,000 patients in hospital waiting to be discharged - either into long-term care or further recovery. This figure has not dropped below four figures since June.Cancer waiting times showed an improvement and were at their best levels since early summer 2022, with 53.9% of patients starting treatment within two months of cancer being suspected. The only area where things did not get better was the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area - although it still had the highest proportion of people starting treatment within the target time. While it is due to eventually rise, the target is currently 75%.The Welsh government spokesman said: \"Whilst we acknowledge emergency care performance is not where we expect it to be, we are driving system improvements, including extending same-day emergency care services to open seven days a week, improving management of 999 patients on the phone, and recruiting more staff. \"Without all this the pressure on the system would be even greater.\"Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth called for \"new and innovative thinking\" to \"drastically improve\" waiting times, saying the situation is a \"crisis\". \"These are another dire set of figures that only serve to highlight the daily suffering in the Labour-run NHS in Wales where patient safety is at risk and staff morale is utterly broken,\" said Welsh Conservatives health spokesman Russell George.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the Dyson founder urged the government to \"incentivise private innovation and demonstrate its ambition for growth\".Michael Gove, levelling-up secretary, said the government was \"firing on all cylinders\" to help business.A prominent supporter of Brexit with a fortune worth £23bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List, Sir James said the government believed it could \"impose tax upon tax on companies in the belief that penalising the private sector is a free win at the ballot box\".\"This is as short-sighted as it is stupid. In the global economy, companies will simply choose to transfer jobs and invest elsewhere,\" he warned.The high-profile businessman's comments come after the government announced in the autumn £25bn worth of tax rises in an attempt to balance the books and restore credibility to the UK's finances after the economic fallout of the Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget.One of the mini-budget polices reversed was a change to corporation tax, which is paid to the government by UK companies and foreign companies with UK offices. It is set to rise from 19% to 25% in April.UK businesses, as well as households, are also dealing with the highest rate of inflation for four decades, with energy bills driving price rises through supply chains.Chaz Curry is one of thousands of business owners to close their doors in 2022.He told the BBC he decided to shut Roots Cycleworks, a bicycle repair and hire and repair shop based in Exmouth, because of several factors including inflation, import issues, supplies of parts and customers' disposable income decreasing. He is set to start a new job next month.\"All of those pressures, it's kind of death by a thousand cuts,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"The business this time last year was in a very good state and we have literally watched it over the course of months sort of go down the plug hole.\"Mr Curry said he was not looking for government handouts, but added he did believe some business policies had been \"a bit route one\" and that ministers had been distracted by the end of Boris Johnson's premiership and the following Conservative leadership elections at a time when governments overseas \"seemed to be acting to put money back into the general public's pocket\".\"Do I feel like there could have been a little bit more creative thinking? Yeah, maybe I do,\" he said.In his comment piece, Sir James repeated his concern over working-from-home policies following the height of the Covid pandemic.He said the government had \"yet to direct\" workers to return to workplaces after \"ordering them to stay at home\".\"This has badly damaged the country's work ethic,\" he said.He argued \"no weight\" had been afforded to the \"importance of face-to-face collaboration, shared culture, mental health, productivity and output, or the training of new and young employees\", which he said was \"fundamental to the success of businesses and employees alike\".But the entrepreneur wrote that the UK could \"shake off its Covid inertia\" and \"turn things around, but only if fast-growing companies are allowed to thrive here\".He said the government had a \"role to play\", starting with the spring Budget in March. \"It must incentivise private innovation and demonstrate its ambition for growth,\" he said.However, Mr Gove rejected Sir James' view that the country needed to \"shake off its Covid inertia\", saying the government was committed to reducing inflation and growing the economy.\"If we are being accused of inertia I think it's important that we stress the energy at which we are pursing smarter regulation in a variety different ways that will help enterprise,\" he told the BBC.The UK electric vehicle industry was dealt a blow earlier this week when battery start-up Britishvolt collapsed into administration, with the majority of its 232 staff made redundant.The firm had planned to build a giant factory to make electric car batteries in Blyth, Northumberland, and ministers had hailed it as a \"levelling up\" opportunity that would boost the region's economy and support the future of UK car making.Sir John Armitt, chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, which advises the government, told the BBC it the Britishvolt failure was \"very disappointing\", but said he was hopeful the plant could be \"resurrected\".Mr Gove said the government knew the site where Britishvolt had planned its factory was \"hugely valuable, hugely attractive\".\"We do know the approach we are taking towards electric vehicles will mean there will be more investment of this kind in the future,\" he added.Asked about Sir James' comments, Sir John said investment in the UK was \"probably declining\" in part because of the concern over regulatory changes with the EU following Brexit.\"I think we should as far as possible continue to comply with EU regs because that makes it easier for companies to compete in Europe,\" he added.Sir James had faced criticism previously when he announced he would relocate his firm's global head office to Singapore from Malmesbury in Wiltshire in 2019.In 2021, he moved his residency back to the UK from Singapore.","Description":"Sir James Dyson has accused the government of having a \"stupid\" and \"short-sighted\" approach to the economy and business in the UK.He said growth had \"become a dirty word\" during Rishi Sunak's premiership.

Automated voice messages direct people to the HMRC website in much the same way as the new text message will for relatively simple enquiries.A text answer will be triggered based on a customer's reason for calling.

It is not acceptable not to answer calls from people who are trying to pay the government money,\" the committee said.It said that HMRC's plan was to move people onto better-received online services, but it questioned whether this would reduce demand for phonelines, improve the quality of service, or be appropriate for all circumstances or customers.Richard West, director of personal tax operations at HMRC, said: \"Redirecting these sorts of queries to online services should help customers find the answer more quickly. It also means calls from customers during the current self-assessment peak, whose questions cannot easily be answered online and require help from an adviser, get the appropriate support they need.   \"Customers who cannot use digital services will be able to get support in the normal way.

Once developed, the ambition is for them to generate enough electricity for seven million homes.This will add to the existing 36 operational offshore wind farms on Crown Estate sites off the coasts of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Dan Labbad, chief executive of the Crown Estate, hailed the benefits of this \"next generation of projects\".\"They demonstrate the far-reaching value that our world-class offshore wind sector can deliver for the nation - home-grown energy for all, jobs and investment for communities, revenue for the taxpayer, clean energy for the benefit of the environment, and a considerate, sustainable approach which respects our rich biodiversity,\" he said.","Description":"King Charles has asked for a surge in profits from six new offshore wind farms on the Crown Estate, worth £1bn, to be used for the \"wider public good\", rather than the Royal Family.

Life in the Royal Family is under increased scrutiny after the release of Prince Harry's memoir Spare, which followed a Netflix documentary series about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.King Charles was the firstborn son of Queen Elizabeth II, and he inherited the throne on 8 September, immediately after her death at the age of 96 at Balmoral Castle.A period of national mourning was declared, and he was formally proclaimed King two days later.Thousands of people queued up to see the Queen's coffin lying in state in Westminster Hall in the Houses of Parliament in the days leading up to her funeral. Her funeral service at Westminster Abbey was attended by 2,000 people, including leaders and dignitaries from around the world.Thousands of people lined the streets as her coffin was transported to Windsor Castle, where a committal service was held. She was buried later, alongside her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.The King is the UK head of state. However, his powers are symbolic and ceremonial, and he remains politically neutral.He receives daily dispatches from the government in a red leather box, such as briefings ahead of important meetings, or documents needing his signature.     The prime minister normally meets the King on a Wednesday at Buckingham Palace, to keep him informed on government matters.These meetings are completely private and there is no official record of what is said. The King also has a number of parliamentary functions:In addition, the King hosts visiting heads of state, and meets foreign ambassadors and high commissioners based in the UK. He leads the annual Remembrance event in November at the Cenotaph in London.The King is also head of the Commonwealth, an association of 56 independent countries and 2.5 billion people. For 14 of these countries, known as the Commonwealth realms, he is their head of state.A coronation is the ceremony at which the monarch is formally crowned. It takes place after a period of mourning for the previous sovereign.  Elizabeth II became Queen on 6 February 1952 on the death of her father King George VI, but was not crowned until 2 June 1953. King Charles III's coronation will take place on Saturday 6 May 2023 at Westminster Abbey in London. He will be the 40th monarch to be invested there. During the ceremony, the King will be crowned alongside Camilla, the Queen Consort. The occasion will be marked by an additional bank holiday across the UK on Monday 8 May 2023.The coronation is an Anglican religious service, carried out by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The monarch is anointed with \"holy oil\", and receives the orb and sceptre, symbols of royalty. At the climax of the ceremony, the Archbishop will place St Edward's Crown on Charles's head - a solid gold crown, dating from 1661.This is the centrepiece of the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, and is only worn by the monarch at the moment of coronation itself. Unlike royal weddings, the coronation is a state occasion - the government pays for it, and ultimately decides the guest list.Queen Elizabeth's coronation was the first to be broadcast live on TV, and was watched by more than 20 million people. After stepping down, they moved to Montecito in California, saying they wanted space to raise their family.Harry remained a Prince, and the couple kept their Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles, but are no longer addressed as His/Her Royal Highness (HRH).The Duke also gave up his official military titles. Since June 2020, the couple has not received any money from Royal sources. They earn much of their income from commercial arrangements.Previously, they had been funded through the Sovereign Grant and the then Prince of Wales' estate, the Duchy of Cornwall. The Sussexes' media company Archewell Productions is behind various podcasts for Spotify and is making a range of programmes for Netflix.This includes a six-part documentary series in which the couple discussed life in the Royal Family, press intrusion and racism.Prince Harry's memoir Spare detailed a series of claims about his troubled relationship with his brother and the rest of the Royal Family.Harry and Meghan returned to the UK for the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee in June 2022, and her funeral in September.In an interview with ITV ahead of the publication of Spare, Prince Harry would not confirm whether he would attend his father's coronation.The order of succession sets out which member of the Royal Family takes over as monarch when the existing one dies or abdicates. First in line - the heir to the throne - is the monarch's eldest child.Royal succession rules were amended in 2013 to ensure that sons no longer take precedence over their older sisters. As Queen Elizabeth's firstborn child, Charles became King on his mother's death and his wife, Camilla, became Queen Consort. King Charles's heir is his elder son, Prince William. Prince William's eldest child Prince George is second in line to the throne, and his daughter Princess Charlotte is third. Prince Louis is fourth and Prince Harry is fifth. King Charles and the Queen Consort live in Buckingham Palace. They previously split their time between Clarence House in London and Highgrove in Gloucestershire.Other Royal residences include Windsor Castle, Sandringham in Norfolk, the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, and Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire.

Its aim was to close the gap between rich and poor parts of the country by improving services such as education, broadband and transport.The Portsmouth bid would have seen the creation of a \"truly world class city centre\", including car-free spaces along with improvements to the Guildhall and Theatre Royal.Mr Morgan, Labour MP for Portsmouth South, said he was \"deeply disappointed\" the city received no funding in the latest round of financial handouts from the government.\"Investment in our city centre would have revitalised Portsmouth and I know from speaking with residents and local businesses that there was great hope that the government would back our bid, especially after cutting so many services in the city over the years,\" he said.\"The government has again overlooked Portsmouth, proving once and for all that 'levelling up' has never been anything more than a slogan.\"Southampton received £20m to improve the athletics centre and create a new sports pitch at the Outdoor Sports Centre.The city council had also applied for funding for heritage enhancements to the Bargate, transport connectivity and the regeneration of Mayflower Park, as well as money for flood defences and cycleway improvements along the shores of the River Itchen.Councillor Sarah Bogle, member for economic development, tweeted she was \"disappointed\" they were turned down.Hampshire County Council also failed for a second time in its bid for funds to improve walking and cycling routes into Havant and Gosport town centres.The only other successful bid in Hampshire saw £20m agreed for a state-of-the-art leisure centre, library and cultural space in Farnborough.The Isle of Wight, allocated £5.8m in the first round of funding in 2021, was unsuccessful in its bid for the Island Green Link, a multimillion-pound sustainable transport project.The island's Conservative MP Bob Seely insisted the previous grant for a heavy lifting crane in East Cowes shipyard had been the \"absolute priority\".He also said the island had received \"an additional £120m\" over the past five years, including funding for St Mary's Hospital, Island Line rail infrastructure and Isle of Wight College.Speaking in Lancashire earlier, Rishi Sunak defended the richer south-east of England getting more than the north-east.He said: \"Two thirds of all the levelling up funding is going to the most deprived parts of our country.\"Levelling up is about making sure people feel pride in the places they call home - it's about driving jobs and investment.\"Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

It does not create a right to wild camp - it is a private arrangement and will last for twelve months. The amount landowners will be paid will be met by the DNP.

The proposals would also see council tenants' rent rise by 7%. But proposed funding cuts for parks, libraries and the council tax reduction scheme, which helps poorest families, were shelved after a backlash.Opposition councillors welcomed the U-turn on cuts, but accused the Labour-controlled council of \"frittering away\" cash on \"hopeless commercial ventures\".The council tax hike equates to a £94.87 increase for band D properties, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Mayor Marvin Rees said every penny rise in council rents, to £90.76 a week, would be spent on repairs and improvements to tenants' homes.Despite the extra income, the authority still faces a £20.3m budget gap in 2023/24, increasing to £40.2m in four years.Cabinet papers suggest the worst-case scenario by 2027/28 is a £125m blackhole.Other revenue-raising measures include charging second-home owners full council tax and increasing the cost of garden waste collections from £32 to £50 a year. The updated budget is due to be recommended by Mr Rees' cabinet on Tuesday before being put before full council next month.Initial plans would have seen cuts of £1.5m for parks, a £1.4m budget drop for libraries and £3m savings on the council tax reduction scheme. All three were reversed following public feedback.A further £8.8m will be used from council reserves over the next three years in a bid to balance the books.Mr Rees said: \"More than a decade of government austerity has already cut council budgets to the bone, but despite the challenges, we have found a way to continue to protect frontline services.\"Since putting the budget out to consultation, we have adjusted our proposals to better reflect our, and fellow Bristolians' priorities.\"The council's change of course also means plans to move the city's central library have been dropped.

The problem is that wherever there are winners, there are inevitably losers too. The North East and Cumbria did receive £175m spread around projects in Gateshead, Teesside and west Cumbria.But other areas - like North Shields and Wallsend - were unsuccessful in their bids. Then there's the thorny issue of how money is allocated between regions.As the North East has the highest unemployment rate and some of the worst levels of deprivation, there's an expectation it will get the most funding. But on this occasion London and the South East had more successful projects and more cash - although of course it also has far more people living there and its own pockets of deprivation.A total of 111 areas across the UK have been awarded money from the second round of the government's £2.1bn Levelling Up Fund.The Institute for Government has said councils' central government grants - including retained business rates - were cut 37% in real terms between 2009-10 and 2019-20, from £41.0bn to £26.0bn in 2019-20 prices.Ann Thomson, Barrow Borough Council leader, described the area's regeneration money as a \"cause for huge celebration\" with plans in place to update the area's Market Hall.Two smaller awards for projects in the county have also come from the government's £150m UK Community Ownership Fund.Keswick Youth Centre Services CIO is to receive £250,000 to buy, renovate and operate the Grade II-listed Keswick School of Industrial Art building, while £300,000 was allocated to The Roxy Collective in South Lakeland.Follow BBC North East \u0026 Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

The Croner review was conducted about four weeks before the January 2 fire and, according to The Courier, states: \"At the time of the visit the standard of health and safety management at this site was below an acceptable level with some health and safety matters requiring urgent management corrective action.\"The electrical wiring in the hotel was among the areas of concern with the report adding: \"There is no evidence that the fixed hard-wired electrical system has been subject to a periodic inspection within the recommended timescales, and an Electrical Inspection Condition Report has not been issued within the recommended timescales.\"Croner Group recommended that an inspection should be carried out throughout the building by a qualified electrical engineer.The review found 29 areas of concern, including: The alarm at the New County Hotel was raised at about 05:10 on 2 January, leading to a huge response from the emergency services. There were 21 ambulance crews, 60 firefighters and nine fire appliances at the scene at its peak.About 16 hotel guests and two people from neighbouring flats were evacuated and it was confirmed later that day that three people had died in the blaze. Police and fire service investigations into the incident are continuing. Paul Holcroft, managing director at Croner, said: \"In light of the ongoing investigation into this matter it would not be appropriate for us to provide detailed comment further to that contained within the report. We will, of course, co-operate fully with any requests for information from the relevant authorities.\"BBC Scotland has so far been unable to contact hotel owner Rashid Hussain but he previously told The Times he was not involved in the day-to-day running of the venue and dismissed claims of health and safety concerns at the hotel as \"untrue\".","Description":"Health and safety experts raised 23 areas needing \"urgent\" attention at a Perth hotel weeks before a fatal fire. \"Croner Group recommended that an inspection should be carried out throughout the building by a qualified electrical engineer. \"BBC Scotland has so far been unable to contact hotel owner Rashid Hussain but he previously told The Times he was not involved in the day-to-day running of the venue and dismissed claims of health and safety concerns at the hotel as \"untrue\".\n","Date":"2023-01-19 13:51:00.000Z","Url":"/news/uk-scotland-64332820","ImgUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16A69/production/_128177729_fire2-lukaskuba.jpg"},{"Topic":"Scotland","Title":"Medical cannabis company secures £2m investment","Article":"A medical cannabis company based in the south of Scotland has secured a £2m investment that will allow it to make its first commercial sales.Hilltop Leaf in Dumfries and Galloway has Scotland's first medicinal cannabis cultivation and production facility.

It's slow, it's small, its unreliable in poor weather and this has a huge impact on the Fair Isle community,\" she said.\"This investment will make a huge difference, not just to the community of Fair Isle but to the whole of Shetland and we very much welcome it.\"There's a lot of work to do before we can deliver on this, but knowing we've got the funding is a huge start.\"She added: \"The sustainability of the island really was at risk. That's how serious the situation was. We don't have a spare £27m to fund a ferry.\"Meanwhile, the 163-year-old Palace Theatre and Grand Hall In Kilmarnock will receive £20m, which will also be spent on a new park near the town square.A similar sum has been allocated to transform Peterhead's disused Arbuthnot House into a new museum, library and cultural hub, while the marine aquarium in Macduff will also be modernised and expanded.  In Stirling, more than £19m will go towards the regeneration of the Forthside area in a bid to help create 1,000 new jobs.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: \"Through greater investment in local areas, we can grow the economy, create good jobs and spread opportunity everywhere. \"That's why we are backing a number of projects with new transformational funding to level up local communities in Scotland.\"Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said £2.1bn of funding across the UK would benefit more than 100 \"transformational projects\".Elsewhere in Scotland: Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the projects would \"breathe new life into communities\" across the country.He added: \"So far we have announced more than £2.26 billion - including the two Freeports confirmed last week - to bring prosperity and growth to Scotland that is crucial as we tackle the challenges associated with rising energy prices and the increased cost of living.\" But Richard Lochhead questioned the process by which the grants were awarded.He said: \"While the Scottish government welcomes all extra funding for Scotland, it is unacceptable for the UK government to decide how money is spent in areas of devolved responsibility.\"The fund gives little consideration to Scotland's longstanding economic needs or remote, rural, and sparsely populated regions by using a methodology which takes no account of these distinct needs.\"Mr Lochhead also claimed the fund \"cuts across devolved policy\" and created \"fragmentation and confusion\" for local authorities and partner agencies.It's been a rollercoaster week for relations between the Scottish and UK governments.Nicola Sturgeon and Rishi Sunak were all smiles when they met up in Inverness, but are now locked in an absolutely furious row over the blocking of Holyrood's gender reform legislation.These levelling-up funds might provide a longer-term insight into how the two governments want to interact.It's part of a very deliberate strategy by UK ministers to directly fund local projects to underline that there are two governments working to make a visible difference in Scotland.The decision to fund a new ferry also has a faint air of trolling about it, given the Scottish government's own shipbuilding struggles on the Clyde.But of course Scottish ministers hate the idea of anything that cuts them out of the loop, particularly in devolved areas like transport.It's hard to complain too much about cash being committed to communities, but they are growing increasingly vocal about how these funds are being distributed.","Description":"A new ferry for one of Britain's most remote inhabited islands is among 10 projects in Scotland that will benefit from UK government funding.

Connections festival returns for 30th year","Article":"Celtic Connections is returning for its 30th festival after two years of programmes disrupted by the pandemic. The celebration of Celtic, folk, roots and world music opens at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on Thursday with performances from artists who have taken part over the past three decades.About 1,500 performers will put on 150 shows at 30 venues across Glasgow. There will also be ceilidhs, workshops, talks and exhibitions over the 18-day festival.During the last \"live\" festival in January 2020, about 130,000 people attended more than 300 events.However, the 2021 festival, which began as the Covid-19 vaccine programme was being rolled out across Scotland, went ahead with its full line-up streamed only online. With the Omicron variant taking hold in the UK last year, many Celtic Connections events were cancelled or played to smaller audiences when indoor crowds were limited to 200.Performances were shown online and only 23,000 people attended in person for the hybrid festival. This year's opening concert will host the big band - originally brought together online for the 2021 digital opening night. Other contributors from the past 30 years of Celtic Connections include Scandinavian folk roots band Basco, Western Isles band Peat and Diesel, Irish musician Liam O Maonlai, fiddle legend Duncan Chisholm, Gaelic singer Kathleen MacInnes, Scottish Dance Theatre, Glasgow-based six piece TRIP, and The National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland.Creative producer Donald Shaw said he was going into this year's festival with \"feelings of immense determination, pride and gratitude\". \"Sharing our music and our arts is a vital part of our human existence - it allows us to feel rooted in place and connected to one another, enriching our lives in the process. Over the last 30 years, this is what Celtic Connections has always been about.\"The festival - thought to be Europe's largest winter festival - closes on 5 February with the BBC Young Traditional Musician of the Year final and Transatlantic Sessions' 20-year celebration of showcasing the shared traditions from Scotland, Ireland and the US. Bailie Annette Christie, chair of Glasgow Life - the charity that operates the city council's leisure facilities and supports the festival - said it had grown to become \"Europe's leading traditional music festival\".\"It's a particularly special occasion this year as we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the festival and acknowledge the huge contribution it has made over three decades to Glasgow's rich cultural offer,\" she added.","Description":"Celtic Connections is returning for its 30th festival after two years of programmes disrupted by the pandemic.

So what are problems that need to be fixed?2022 was the year when the health service shifted focus from combatting Covid to dealing with its consequences - and that is set to be the major theme of this year.  One of the most extreme examples can be seen in A\u0026E where there has been record numbers of people facing long waits. This has been an upward trend for the past 12 months. The picture in emergency departments tells us the story of what is happening everywhere else in health and social care.The above chart shows the stark difference between people experiencing long waits in A\u0026E at the start of 2023 compared with the equivalent in previous years.  In the first week of 2016, just three patients waited longer than 12 hours in A\u0026E. This year, it was 2,511 - one in every 10 patients.Emergency medicine doctors have issued multiple warnings about the unsafe conditions, with patients waiting for hours on chairs or on trolleys in departments that are understaffed. A number have told me they are extremely worried that these sort of conditions are being allowed to become normalised. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine has repeatedly warned people are dying as a result of such long waits.The issues are not being caused by more people turning up at A\u0026E. In fact, the numbers are almost exactly the same for both 2016 and 2023.  The problem is that there are no free beds to admit patients. Things do change hour by hour as staff try to create capacity, but there are many occasions when there are more patients than there are beds.Some of that is about an increase in flu and Covid cases. Another consequence of the pandemic is there are more sick people because their treatment was delayed. But by far the biggest problem is getting people out of hospital when they no longer need the highest level of care.  The number of hospital beds occupied by patients who are medically ready to be discharged is now at its highest level ever.On any given day, about one in six of Scotland's acute hospital bed capacity is being taken up by people who do not need to be there.  Sometimes that is because people require complex care packages like adjustments to their house or they are waiting for a space in a specific care home.But all too often people can't get out of hospital because there are not enough carers, or community healthcare staff, to provide the support required. The demand for social care is only going to grow as the population gets older.  On a visit to a care of the elderly ward, the consultant in charge explained to me that 30 years ago the average age of a patient in these wards would be about 70 - now it is 90.  Living longer is positive news but most people over the age of 65 live with at least one long-term medical condition and to look after them requires a major shift in the delivery of healthcare. The Scottish government's proposed long-term solution is the National Care Service, billed by the health secretary as the \"biggest public sector reform\" since the NHS was established in 1948. There are bold plans to end a postcode lottery of social care and to set up a series of national care boards that operate in the same way as NHS health boards.But already concerns around its cost have been highlighted by both the public spending watchdog and the Scottish Parliament's finance committee.A number of charities are worried too. The chair of the Neurological Alliance of Scotland, Tanith Muller, wrote in a blog that the proposals claim to be \"big on ideas but a short on detail\".  The National Care Service bill will continue to be scrutinised by parliament this year but some organisations are calling for it to be scrapped and others for it to be put on hold.While all that plays out, the problems with shortages in social care are acute right now and continue to cause major capacity issues in hospitals.A short-term plan to spend £8m on interim care home beds has been announced to free-up hospital beds.Money will be taken from one part of the health and social care budget to pay for 300 care home beds so patients can be moved out of hospital while they wait for care. That's in addition to 600 interim beds that are already being used as a stop-gap for patients in some areas. Many of those working in social care question spending millions of pounds on short-term fixes when the severe shortage of staff in social care needs to be addressed in the long term.Akbar Mir, who runs Elsie Inglis nursing home in Edinburgh - which is looking after interim care patients - said integration between hospitals and the community should have been a priority well before now.  \"We are medicalising growing old,\" he said \"People should be entitled to access the care they need in the community with the aim of avoiding hospitals altogether.\"One of the biggest issues the NHS faces just now is finding enough beds and staff to make a dent in the huge backlog of planned elective procedures it has to catch up on after Covid.  A number of health boards have had to postpone things like hip and knee replacements or some less urgent surgeries like gallstone or tonsil removal because they are so busy.  However, the numbers waiting for non-urgent, planned care have also risen to record highs. I have spoken to many patients who have been unable to work while they wait, such is their level of pain or lack of mobility.  Some have spent their savings on private treatment because their condition is so debilitating and GPs say increasing numbers of patients need stronger medication or mental health support as their condition deteriorates. In turn that can also lead to more emergency admissions if people become seriously ill. In July last year, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf set what he described as \"ambitious\" targets to eradicate the longest waits for treatment.  He said that from the end of August 2022, no-one in most specialties should wait for longer than two years for an outpatient appointment after being referred to see a specialist.  By September, two-year waits for inpatient treatment should end.  While progress has been made, neither of those targets has been met and the most recent data to the end of September shows more than 2,000 patients were waiting over two years for outpatient care, with more than 7,600 waiting that long for inpatient care. The Scottish government also set out plans to build a series of national treatment centres to improve waiting times. Three are due to open this year but, as we reported in August 2022, a number are already delayed.Some doctors who welcome the idea of having protected units for elective operations tell me they don't see how the staff can be found without taking them from another already stretched part of the service. And what we are seeing now is health boards having to postpone even more elective care to prioritise urgent cases will have an impact on any improvements on waiting times.The NHS is facing extreme pressure this winter, as hospitals struggle with a difficult flu season and staff shortages, as well as backlogs due to Covid.Enter a postcode to find out what is happening in your area with A\u0026E, ambulances and hospital waiting lists across the UK.If you can't see the lookup, click hereProduced by Libby Rogers, Rob England, Nick Triggle, Jana Tauschinski, Harriet Agerholm and Christine Jeavans.

Testing by Jerina Jacobs.The NHS is Scotland's biggest employer and the workforce has grown by over 10% in the past five years to 155,000. However there are still record vacancies.  One in 10 nursing and midwifery posts are unfilled. That's more than 6,000 vacancies.The official data suggests 6% of consultant and dental posts are vacant, although the British Medical Association (BMA) say it is more like 14%. GP numbers have gone down this year despite a commitment from government to recruit 800 new family doctors by 2028. And there continues to be struggles attracting people to work in social care. For patients, this could mean they have to join a larger GP surgery further away from home - with longer waits for appointments. It might also lead to some specialist NHS services not being delivered because there are not enough consultants. For example, difficulties recruiting enough district nurses could compromise access to care at home.The Scottish government has increased funded training places for medical staff but last week the health secretary told parliament that of 750 overseas nursing and midwifery staff that were due to be appointed this winter, just 126 firm offers have been received - with 455 \"in the pipeline\".  It has always been challenging to recruit enough highly-trained people.  One pharmacist I spoke to in Perth told me that they had advertised for five full-time pharmacists but had only been able to recruit one part-time member of staff. Scotland is giving NHS staff a larger pay increase than anywhere else in the UK.  'Agenda for Change' staff such as nurses, paramedics, porters and nursing assistants will get an average 7.5% pay increase. Some unions have accepted this deal and while the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of Midwives and GMB rejected the offer. Discussions continue over next year's pay with strike action on hold for now.  Cancer services are seen as a priority for the NHS, alongside urgent care. When taking different cancers together, it is the leading cause of death in Scotland.Survival rates have improved over the past decade, despite more people being diagnosed with the disease.  It is seen as a barometer of the progress being made in tackling big public health issues as well as inequalities. But charities and cancer specialists are worried delays in starting treatment could reverse some of that progress.The government has a target that 95% of patients who are referred for an urgent suspicion of cancer should start treatment within two months.  The latest quarterly data shows 25% of those who were referred waited longer than 62 days - the worst figures since the standard was set in 2012.  The main concern is that people who do have cancer will receive a diagnosis too late and a treatable disease will become terminal.Cancer doctors have seen more of this because people were not coming forward during the height of Covid and there were fewer referrals.  Cancer Research UK recently published a report using public data that suggested almost 5,000 additional cancer cases a year were directly linked to deprivation and their fear is that the cost of living crisis will exacerbate that if people are having to choose between work or making a doctor's appointment. One of the key plans by the government to tackle this is to establish more rapid diagnostic centres to speed up early detection for people with non-specific symptoms. It is due to publish a new cancer strategy this spring.","Description":"The health service has never before been under such strain, with dire warnings from doctors about patient safety. The issues are not being caused by more people turning up at A\u0026E. In fact, the numbers are almost exactly the same for both 2016 and 2023. Sometimes that is because people require complex care packages like adjustments to their house or they are waiting for a space in a specific care home. But all too often people can't get out of hospital because there are not enough carers, or community healthcare staff, to provide the support required. On a visit to a care of the elderly ward, the consultant in charge explained to me that 30 years ago the average age of a patient in these wards would be about 70 - now it is 90.

Mr Merriman responded that he was \"keen to ensure the [OLR] has a manageable portfolio\" but \"decisions will be made\" on Transpennine if it cannot turn itself around.However, he added that there had been criticism about the performance of another rail operator, Northern, which is currently run by the OLR.London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and Southeastern Trains are also run by the OLR.Transpennine has blamed its cancellations on high sickness rates and a backlog of driver training caused by the pandemic.   The train operator also lacks a current agreement on rest day working with the drivers' union Aslef.On Wednesday, Mick Whelan, Aslef's general secretary, was asked on the BBC's Today programme why members had not been given a vote on an offer of 1.5 times pay for working overtime.He responded that pay had not gone up in several years, and the point of rest day working was not to cover services. Asked if an agreement on rest day working would mean more trains running, he said: \"I don't think my people would work those trains for a lower rate of pay even if we had an agreement.\"Mr Whelan added: \"We have a company that's operating in totally bad faith and smashing every agreement we've got\".He said Transpennine has \"poor performance, poor industrial relations and can't operate in the 21st Century\".Ministers have repeatedly said a reliance on rest day working needs to end.A Transpennine Express spokesperson said the company was \"committed to the communities we serve and want to assure our customers that we are doing all we can to deliver a train service they can rely on\".The firm had removed services from its timetable on a day-to-day basis due to \"very high levels of sickness and a training backlog following the pandemic\", said the spokesperson, adding that Transpennine \"continues to work flat-out to deliver higher levels of service delivery and to tackle the issues that are being experienced by customers\".Mr Merriman had already said on Wednesday that Transpennine Express' contract was under consideration. He told the Transport Select Committee: \"If a train operator is not performing and it appears clear that they can't perform and can't turn this around, then that contract would come to an end and we wouldn't hesitate to put it into the Operator of Last Resort.\" \"I am already looking at what needs to be done... with regards to that contract,\" he added.  Mr Merriman said he had weekly data on Transpennine and another troubled operator, Avanti West Coast, and what they were doing to improve performance.Mr Merriman also told the Transport Select Committee on Wednesday he would meet the regulator about cancellations in advance.This can happen up to 10pm the night before and are not included in on-the-day cancellation figures.Mr Merriman said these currently outnumbered on-the-day cancellations on Transpennine Express.  On Thursday, he told the House of Commons the practice needed \"a good look\" and the current levels on Transpennine gave him concern.The government recently gave another troubled operator, Avanti West Coast, six months to urgently improve.Mr Merriman has said Avanti had increased services in December without relying on rest day working, and recruited more drivers, but a period of industrial action over Christmas meant it was hard to assess whether improvements were working.He said Avanti's performance had been much improved over the past couple of weeks and he hoped the operator was \"turning a corner\".","Description":"Labour is calling for train operator Transpennine Express to have its contract removed.

However, critics say it leaves vulnerable customers at risk of running out of credit and \"self-disconnecting\" when they cannot afford to top up.To date, an estimated 600,000 people have been switched to prepay, according to Citizens Advice, either by their supplier physically installing a meter in their home, or automatically having their smart meter switched to prepay mode.In a letter to Ofgem, the Department for Businesses is expected to call for greater scrutiny of whether these switches are justified.Energy suppliers point out that if customers are allowed to build up unaffordable debts, then this money would eventually be recouped from everyone's energy bills.Citizens Advice said it helped more people unable to top up their prepayment meter last year than in the previous 10 years combined.It said that among its clients, 38% of those were single people, and 37% were single parents.The data also shows that, among its clients, a majority of people in this situation were disabled or had a long-term health condition.Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"In the past, prepayment meters may have worked as a solution for some people on a low-income.\"Now, she said these meters were a \"squeeze point\" for people's finances, leading to some sitting in \"cold, dark homes\".Audrey Ridson, 81, from Hampshire, told the BBC earlier this month that she was in hospital recovering from a fall when her energy firm switched her to a prepayment account.\"[The supplier] said: 'We've changed it over already to a card payment and you'll have to go to a local shop [to top up the meter]'. \"My daughter-in-law said: 'She won't be able to do that. She's got to have a special walking stick. She won't be able to get up to town'. And they didn't listen to her. It was dangerous to go up there for me because I had this injury.\"They charged me nearly £200 a month just for a shower and a light near my cooker,\" Audrey told the BBC.She added that she had built up arrears while she was recovering in hospital from the fall.Dhara Vyas, deputy chief executive at Energy UK, which represents energy firms, said: \"Suppliers are required to have exhausted all other options before installing a prepayment meter by warrant - only after repeated unsuccessful attempts to contact the customer to discuss repayment options and checks to ensure they do not go ahead when customers are in the most vulnerable situations.\"She said that difficult decisions had to be taken about indebted customers, as suppliers were required to try to prevent them falling further into arrears. \"Any increase in bad debt ultimately ends up costing all consumers more money, as it is recouped from bills,\" she said.The boss of British Gas, Chris O'Shea, said his company would stop remote switching of smart meters, and pledged £10m in support. This could include non-repayable credit of up to £250 for those struggling the most to top-up their meter.\"We know that some prepayment customers are self-disconnecting and not coming forward for help, so we have reviewed our policies to do more to target support at this group,\" he said.Other suppliers have offered crisis help and reduced some of their demands on paying back emergency credit.","Description":"Calls are growing for energy suppliers to stop forcibly switching customers who struggle to pay their bills onto prepayment meters.

Then it disappeared. \"I felt sick. It kind of slowly dawned on me… that it had just vanished,\" says Mrs Brown, a parenting blogger and author of Confessions of a Crummy Mummy.Her site had been in the hands of cloud hosting provider Gridhost, which shut down in November. Mrs Brown never received notifications about the switch-off because her blog had been set up by a third-party business, which had stopped trading. And she had no access to the backup for her blog either, since it had also been hosted in the cloud by Gridhost. Days of stress ensued. Many tears flowed.Cloud computing, in which information and software are stored in faraway data centres and accessed via the internet, is increasingly popular. It allows small businesses, for example, to set up email or data processing facilities without having to maintain their own IT infrastructure.But when things go wrong, the consequences can be dire. Cloud services can be subject to intermittent outages, or total shutdowns, caused by technical glitches, cyber-security attacks, or even lightning strikes. This is what happens when the cloud bursts.In Mrs Brown's case, her blog is a direct source of income. Companies that make parenting products pay her to link to them, or to publish certain content on her blog, for example. \"It does literally put food on our table,\" says Mrs Brown.She says Gridhost's owner tsoHost would not allow her access to her blog data and she was only able to retrieve it after enlisting the help of her former web developer. \"He said it took him about six hours negotiating with them,\" she recalls.The blog is now live again on another platform and Mrs Brown has scheduled backups with a separate provider. A spokesman for tsoHost said the firm attempted to contact customers in advance of Gridhost's closure and added: \"We understand that the decision to retire the Gridhost platform will be disappointing and tsoHost is working closely with customers to support migrations.\"Using cloud services, by definition, makes a business reliant on a third party, says Vili Lehdonvirta of the Oxford Internet Institute and author of Cloud Empires.\"What is the cloud? Well, the cloud is somebody else's computer,\" he explains.And cloud bursts are not uncommon. Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud provider in the world, suffered a partial outage in December 2021, affecting thousands of customers.Plus, cloud services sometimes get turned off, just like Gridhost. Google is retiring its cloud platform IoT Core this August. People have used it to connect smart home devices, among other things.Data from the Uptime Institute, an advisory organisation, suggests that while the cloud is not getting significantly less reliable overall, high-cost outages are becoming more common. \"Over 60% of failures result in at least $100,000 (£82,000) in total losses, up substantially from 39% in 2019,\" the Institute says.Cloud computing is increasingly popular with companies, says Kristina McElheran at the University of Toronto. She and colleagues conduct regular, large-scale surveys of hundreds of thousands of firms in the US. Citing other research, she also notes that the shift to online working during the pandemic has further accelerated cloud adoption. \"The cloud is a game changer for survival, growth and productivity for the young, especially the young and small,\" explains Dr McElheran, referring to start-ups. \"But this is where the trade-off comes in - they lose control.\"One small business owner who knows this only too well is Pokey Bolton, an artist and event organiser based in Napa Valley, California. In early December 2022, her cloud email provider Rackspace was hit by a ransomware attack, affecting thousands of customers.\"I'm furious,\" she says. It came at a particularly sensitive time because early December is when Ms Bolton traditionally takes lots of bookings for her annual craft workshops in January. \"That's my big money maker, it's key to my business,\" she says. Hundreds of people usually sign up but, having had no email access for several days, she isn't sure how many registrations might have got lost this year. Ms Bolton has switched email providers and says she has attempted to close her Rackspace account but hasn't received written confirmation of this. She is also unsure as to whether hackers accessed her email accounts, which contained some customer data and other sensitive information.A spokeswoman for Rackspace said the firm had been able to help more than three-quarters of affected customers set up new email services on another platform. \"We are proactively reaching out individually to those who still need assistance,\" she added.Rackspace is publishing updates about the situation online.It is important to remember the many benefits of cloud computing, says Prof Lehdonvirta, particularly when it comes to uptime, a measure of how long a computer system works without failing.\"Despite these high-profile outages… [cloud providers] are able to offer crazy uptimes, which are very difficult to achieve in a smaller scale operation,\" he explains. Plus, software running in the cloud can get the latest updates instantly, which should help to keep it secure.More technology of business:In general, cloud companies are able to offer very reliable services because they can spread computing across multiple data centres, says Paul Watson, director of the National Innovation Centre for data at Newcastle University. \"What you can do is detect failure of one data centre and switch over to using the resources in another,\" he says.Very few, if any, small or start-up businesses have such capabilities.Every now and then, a company turns its back on the cloud, though. The chief technology officer of US software firm 37signals recently revealed that his company would be leaving the cloud, partly because of costs but also because of reliability concerns.Better information on the risk of outages could help businesses make informed choices, notes Dr McElheran. And if the cloud computing industry only becomes less competitive and less reliable over time, policymakers might have to step in to force improvements. However, despite recent cloud bursts, she adds, \"I don't think we're there yet.\"","Description":"Natalie Brown had built her blog into a thriving business over the course of a decade, pouring heaps of effort into it.

The letter, also known as a Section 21, told her the landlord was ending her tenancy in November. And Hayley was told to move out of the place she'd called home for almost six years by 26 January.\"The ongoing battle with the landlord... it was it was all building up to this point,\" she says.BBC Newsbeat teamed up with Newsnight to visit Hayley in Bristol.She showed us examples of mould and damage around the rented property she's due to leave.Speaking about the rent increase by her landlord, she says it was \"a tough month\".\"And the house was deteriorating in quality quite rapidly as we were going into winter.\"Hayley says that when she looked into her rights, she found that tenants \"have no power\" and \"conditions have to be extremely bad before you can get any help from the council\".So, despite having a contract with the landlord, Hayley felt \"he just wasn't upholding his end of the bargain\".She researched online but the main advice was to start a conversation with her landlord.\"And that's quite terrifying,\" Hayley says. \"Because as soon as you start your conversation, depending on the landlord, they could just be like: 'this person's kicking up a fuss, I'm going to kick them out'. \"'I can get any number of people who would be willing to live here for more money'.\" Going to court is an option but one that could cost a lot - and Hayley says she didn't want to take the risk because she feels the system is tipped in the landlord's favour.Last year the English Housing Survey said nearly a quarter of private rented housing was below standard.This means it can't be heated or insulated, is in disrepair or could pose a risk to health. Richard Blakeway is the Housing Ombudsman for England - which means the government put him in charge of helping to regulate social housing.He told us that about 90 private landlords had joined a scheme that would allow him to settle disputes between them and their tenants.But he says that's a \"drop in the ocean\", as he thinks there are about two million landlords in the country.\"I think that shows the real gap that exists on accessing free, impartial, independent dispute resolution through an ombudsman for for private renters compared to social renters.\"Richard says the government should introduce laws that force landlords to join the scheme, otherwise little will change.For private landlord Vanessa Warwick, \"ethical and compliant landlords are all for raising standards\".But she says there are existing powers for local authorities to use, which they do not utilise enough.\"If existing powers are not being used, then is it really worthwhile introducing even more?,\" the founder of landlord forum Property Tribe tells Newsbeat.Vanessa feels the housing ombudsman scheme is a good idea for resolving disputes involving damp or mould in properties.\"An independent assessor could go out and look at that property and see what is causing the problem.\"\"Very often you'll find that the tenant is saying that it's the property that's causing mould and then the landlord will say 'you're not ventilating it properly'.\" \"It would be good to have an independent party who could go and assess a property and actually see what the problem is and have the power to enforce for that problem to be rectified.\"The government has told Newsbeat it is \"absolutely committed to delivering a fairer deal for renters\". \"Work is under way to create a new private rented Ombudsman so all tenants, regardless of whether they rent socially or privately, have access to redress where they have a complaint about their home.\" Your first step should always be to report the problem to your landlord. They have responsibilities to make sure your home is fit to live in while you're there, which might include dealing with damp if it makes your home unliveable.Find out if your landlord is responsible, for example, if mould or damp is caused by maintenance or structural problem. If they are, and you've reported the problems to your landlord and they haven't done anything about it, contact your local council.The Environmental Health department might be able to force your landlord to deal with the problem. If no action is taken, it's possible to take your landlord to court. But as this can be expensive and time consuming, it should be a last resort.For more, visit Citizens Advice.For Hayley, it's a bittersweet feeling right now.\"It's all just been so terrifying and very up in the air. But at the same time, the sweet relief of knowing that he's not going to be my landlord anymore.\"\"And this relationship that you're forced into with a landlord in this contract, I could we could finally finish it.\"I could get closure and be done,\" she adds.Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.","Description":"When Hayley Dawson was told her rent would be going up by hundreds of pounds, it was unwelcome but understandable.

So does this mean prices are on their way down too? Unfortunately not. Prices are still rising quite sharply compared to a year ago, just at a slower rate than they have been.A typical bag of shopping that cost £10 in October 2021 would have added up to £11.11 in October 2022. And that same bag of groceries would have been priced at £10.13 in December 2021, but jumped to £11.19 this December just passed, latest figures show.Prices are still likely to keep going up over the next few months, but not at the rate that has caused such a shock to households and businesses across the country over the last year.The inflation figure is an average - so your own cost of living could be rising at a very different rate to what's reported in the news, depending on what you spend your money on.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) which calculates inflation, bases its numbers on a basket of goods that reflects what most people across the UK are buying. But it doesn't include everything. So if you are buying a lot of unusual or niche items, or you have atypical tastes, you might find the cost of your own bag of shopping is going up more quickly - or more slowly - than the headlines suggest.Food inflation is currently at 16.8%, much higher than the average rate, so people who spend a greater proportion of their outgoings on food will find their personal inflation rate is higher than the 10.5% headline figure.The ONS says energy, food, and drink accounts for around 15% of lower-income households' spending, compared to 10% for high-income groups.The Bank of England tries to control inflation by putting up interest rates which makes it more expensive to borrow money. This encourages people to borrow and spend less, and save more.The Bank is expected to stick with that strategy - of putting up interest rates - throughout this year. So if you have a tracker mortgage or a credit card or loan you could find yourself paying more interest. That's another way your own personal inflation rate could be affected.Try our personal inflation rate calculatorOccasionally prices will fall very slightly compared to the previous month, but they are much less likely to fall year-on-year.And while this might be difficult to believe right now, falling prices aren't always a good thing - here's why.If people expect that prices are likely to fall, they delay spending with the aim of getting a cheaper deal later on. That means businesses have less money coming in, so they try to find ways to cut costs - most likely by cutting wages or laying off staff. So prices falling can mean people lose their jobs, which in turn makes prices fall further. This is called \"deflation\", a different kind of economic crisis that brings its own set of problems.That's why the Bank of England aims to have prices consistently rising by 2% - it's better to aim for a bit of inflation than to risk the negative effects of prices falling.It's important to remember that the price rises we've seen recently have been primarily driven by global energy prices. These are expected to come down, but not to as low as they were before, and any fall in energy prices will take time to feed through into the wider economy.","Description":"Every month we report the UK's inflation figures, but what does this percentage going up or down actually mean for your money?The inflation figure gives us an idea of how fast the cost of living is rising in the UK but here are a few things you might not know.

However, while there has been a drop in criminal revenue, the number of attacks is rising.Companies, governments, schools and even hospitals around the world are regularly falling victim to ransomware hackers, who lock staff out of their IT systems until a ransom is paid, usually in Bitcoin.The hackers often threaten to publish or sell stolen data too.Recent high-profile victims include The Guardian newspaper, the Royal Mail delivery company and Sick Kids Canadian children's hospital.  Many ransomware crews are thought to be based in Russia, although Russian officials deny the country is a haven for the groups. Analysts at Chainalysis track the money flowing in and out of Bitcoin wallets which are known to be owned by ransomware crews.Researchers say the criminal proceeds will be much higher than those they can see, because the hackers are likely to use other wallets too.Nonetheless, the company says, the trend is clear: ransomware payments are significantly down.Bill Siegel, of Coveware, which specialises in negotiating with hackers, agrees. His clients are becoming increasingly reluctant to give in to hackers, who can demand millions of dollars. In 2022, 41% of his clients paid ransoms compared with 70% in 2020, he says.No governments have made it illegal to pay hacker ransoms, but Mr Siegel and other cyber-experts think that US sanctions against hacker groups, or those with links to Russia's Federal Security Service, have made paying some groups legally risky. \"We refuse to pay ransoms if there's even a hint of connection to a sanctioned entity,\" Mr Seigel said.Other factors may also be at play, including an increase in ransomware awareness leading to improved cyber-security at organisations.\"Hackers are definitely finding it harder to get paid for ransomware attacks,\" said Brett Callow, threat researcher at cyber-security company Emsisoft. Companies have become better at protecting their back-ups, reducing their need to pay hackers for recovery, he added. \"Additionally, as ransomware attacks have become so common, they are less of a PR disaster for companies, making them less likely to pay to keep incidents quiet and out of the news.\"Despite the drop in revenue, the number of unique ransomware strains being used in attacks reportedly increased dramatically in 2022.Research from cyber-security firm Fortinet found that more than 10,000 unique types of the malicious software were active in the first half of 2022. The growth in the number of attacks last year could be connected with enforcement actions, mainly by the US authorities, which caused some of the largest ransomware groups to disband.In November 2021, alleged members of the REvil gang were arrested around the world in a global police operation, with more than $6m in cryptocurrency retrieved by US authorities in a so-called \"claw back\" hacking operation.   It followed a similar operation by the US in June 2021 that took the Darkside gang offline and recovered $4.1m in stolen funds.It is thought that these actions may have forced criminals to work in smaller groups and also knocked the confidence of gangs.Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?Criminals now seem to be carrying out a greater number of smaller attacks instead of going after large Western targets - so-called \"big-game hunting\" - where large payments are more likely.\"While big-game hunting may have gotten more challenging, it is still rewarding,\" said Jackie Burns Koven, head of cyber-threat intelligence at Chainalysis. She warns ransomware is still extremely profitable and smaller-sized organisations should be even more vigilant as hackers spread their net wider in an effort to be paid.","Description":"Cyber-crime gangs have had a 40% drop in earnings as victims are refusing to pay ransoms, researchers say.

However, all of the nominations scored by both films are for technical prizes. In total, there are 45 films nominated this year across all categories.There are some notable absences - such as actress Olivia Colman and director Steven Spielberg - neither of whom made the Bafta longlist. But some omissions are thought to be at least partly due to the new methods the British Academy uses to determine nominees.The Bafta Film Awards 2023 will take place on 19 February at the Southbank Centre's Royal Festival Hall in London. The ceremony, hosted by Richard E Grant, will air on BBC One.All Quiet On The Western Front is a brutally violent but widely praised adaptation of the novel of the same name. It was previously adapted for the screen in 1930 and 1979.Critics have lavished praise on the latest version, whish is directed by Edward Berger and stars Austrian actor Felix Kammerer. The film looks at World War One from the German perspective, through the eyes of an idealistic young soldier named Paul Bäumer (Kammerer) who is confronted with the increasingly barbaric realities of war.The last non-English language film to win the Bafta for best film was Alfonso Cuarón's Roma in 2019.In the top Bafta category, best film, it faces competition from Baz Luhrmann's Elvis Presley biopic, and Todd Field's psychological drama Tár, which follows a disgraced orchestra conductor.The other nominees include Martin McDonagh's comedy The Banshees of Inisherin, which is about two feuding friends in 1920s Ireland. The film did well at the recent Golden Globes.The madcap sci-fi adventure Everything Everywhere All At Once, which follows a woman who hops through the multiverse exploring different versions of herself, is also in contention.Cate Blanchett talks about conducting an orchestraCate Blanchett is nominated for leading actress for her performance in Tár - in which she plays a renowned orchestra conductor whose career starts to unravel when she is accused of abuse.The actress has previously been nominated for seven Bafta Film Awards, winning three times for Blue Jasmine, The Aviator and Elizabeth.Widely seen as one of the frontrunners for the best actress Oscar, Blanchett faces competition in the category at the Baftas from fellow awards favourite Michelle Yeoh (for Everything Everywhere All At Once).The other nominees are Viola Davis (for The Woman King), Danielle Deadwyler (Till), Ana De Armas (Blonde), and Emma Thompson (Good Luck to You, Leo Grande).Emma Thompson wants to talk about sexThe leading actor category, meanwhile, sees recognition for all three of the Oscar frontrunners - Austin Butler (for Elvis), Brendan Fraser (The Whale) and Colin Farrell (The Banshees of Inisherin).The other nominees in the category are Bill Nighy (for Living), Daryl McCormack (Good Luck to You, Leo Grande) and Paul Mescal (Aftersun).Two actors widely considered as Oscar lock ins in the supporting categories receive Bafta nominations - Angela Bassett (for Wakanda Forever) and Ke Huy Quan (Everything Everywhere All At Once).Across all the acting categories, 40% of the nominees this year are people belonging to ethnic minorities - 10 of the 24 available slots.There are some notable absences in this year's Bafta list - Hollywood giants Steven Spielberg (The Fabelmans) and James Cameron (Avatar: The Way of Water) were not even longlisted for best director.However, such absences are thought to be partly due to the relatively new methods Bafta use to compile nominations. Since 2021's ceremony, juries have been enlisted to determine a certain number of nominees in most categories, as part of a drive to ensure diversity.The director longlist was required to have an even split of male and female nominees. Eight of each were longlisted earlier this month, but more than twice the number of men had been submitted as women.However, Spielberg is nominated in the best original screenplay category - marking the only nomination for The Fabelmans, a strong Oscars contender.In the acting categories, another omission from the longlists was Olivia Colman, usually an awards season favourite. However, her Empire of Light co-star, Michael Ward, is nominated for best supporting actor.Women Talking, which follows abused women from an isolated Mennonite colony, and the popular Knives Out sequel Glass Onion, have been shut out entirely despite receiving four longlist nominations each.First time nominees feature heavily at this year's ceremony, with 14 of the 24 nominees in the performance categories receiving their first ever Bafta Film nomination, including Farrell and Fraser.Mandy Walker is nominated for best cinematographer for her work on Elvis. If she wins, she will become the first ever female winner of the category.All of the nominees in the category for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer are women.They are Charlotte Wells (for Aftersun), Georgia Oakley and Hélène Sifre (Blue Jean), Marie Lidén (Electric Malady), Katy Brand (Good Luck To You, Leo Grande) and Maia Kenworthy (Rebellion).Meanwhile, the nominations for the Bafta rising star award, which recognises promising younger talent, announced earlier this week, include Naomi Ackie, who portrayed Whitney Houston in the recent biopic I Wanna Dance With Somebody.The Woman King's Sheila Atim, Peaky Blinders star Daryl McCormack, and Sex Education stars Aimee Lou Wood and Emma Mackey are also nominated for rising star.The Bafta Film Awards are sandwiched between the Golden Globes, which took place last week, and the Oscars, which will be held on 12 March, marking the conclusion of awards season.Actor Richard E Grant will host this year's ceremony, stepping into the shoes of last year's presenter Rebel Wilson.Grant was most recently nominated for a Bafta himself in 2019, for his performance opposite Melissa McCarthy in Can You Ever Forgive Me?","Description":"Netflix's All Quiet On The Western Front leads the field at this year's Bafta Film Awards, with 14 nominations.

Mrs Salisbury said: \"For me it was the reality of it. The real evidence that babies born under 30 weeks are given every chance possible to live a normal healthy brilliant life like Cormac does. \"He's so active and plays football, and surfs - just a normal crazy nine-year-old.\"Karen Luyt, professor of neonatal medicine at St Michael's Hospital, who set up the prevention of cerebral palsy in pre-term labour (PReCePT) programme in 2014, is the pioneer of magnesium sulphate treatment.As a result of her work it is now standard for every premature birth to be flagged up in maternity wards. Professor Luyt said: \"What this study shows is that the year after implementation 85% of women who were eligible received the drug.\"A significant proportion of women deliver too quickly to receive the drug, but Professor Luyt added: \"Our hopes are that this will be sustained because year-on-year we can prevent cerebral palsy - probably between 100 and 200 cases a year.\" Premature birth is the main cause of brain injury and cerebral palsy in babies.Evidence shows that babies can be protected from brain injury by giving magnesium sulphate to women who are at risk of premature birth. The PReCePT programme aims to support all maternity units in England to increase the use of magnesium sulphate.It was developed in the West of England in 2014, led by the West of England Academic Health Science Network and University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust. It was piloted in five NHS trusts in the west and has since been rolled out across England. Researchers estimate that the programme's first year could be associated with a lifetime saving to society of £3m.John Macleod, National Institute for Health and Care Research ARC West Director and professor in clinical epidemiology and primary care at the University of Bristol, said there had been an uptake in use.\"The programme has increased uptake of magnesium sulphate, which we know is a cost-effective medicine to prevent cerebral palsy, much more quickly than we could have otherwise expected,\" he said.There are minor short-term side effects including sickness and headaches but when it costs almost a million pounds to care for a child with cerebral palsy during their lifetime, preventing up to 200 cases a year will save billions - not to mention giving thousands of youngsters the best quality of life.Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

It's often linked to being overweight or inactive, or having a family history of type 2 diabetes.The researchers have previously shown that an artificial pancreas run by a similar algorithm is effective for patients living with type 1 diabetes, where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. They have also successfully trialled the device in patients with type 2 diabetes who require kidney dialysis.For the most recent trial, the researchers recruited 26 patients who were randomly allocated to one of two groups.The first group would trial the artificial pancreas for eight weeks and then switch to the standard therapy of multiple daily insulin injections; the second group would take this control therapy first and then switch to the artificial pancreas after eight weeks.On average, patients using the artificial pancreas spent two-thirds (66%) of their time within the glucose levels target range - double that while on the control (32%).No patients experienced dangerously-low blood sugar levels during the study. Dr Charlotte Boughton from the Wellcome-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science at the University of Cambridge, who co-led the study, said: \"Many people with type 2 diabetes struggle to manage their blood sugar levels using the currently available treatments, such as insulin injections. \"The artificial pancreas can provide a safe and effective approach to help them, and the technology is simple to use and can be implemented safely at home.\"Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Others contain illegally high levels of nicotine.In the north-east of England alone, more than 1.4 tonnes of illegal vapes were seized from shops in the second half of last year, while in Kent there was a dramatic rise in counterfeit vaping products seized at Channel ports in December, with more than 300,000 removed.One mother in Scotland, who wants to be anonymous, told the BBC that her 15-year-old daughter was sold disposable vapes illegally for months by her local corner shop.\"They sold her 31 disposable vapes and never once asked her for ID,\" she said.\"There would be certain points of the day where she could go in and buy them. She would have to wait for the shopkeeper to give her the nod.\"The woman said she was \"angry\" that corner shops would sell the devices to children \"who are clearly under-age and in their school uniform\".\"I couldn't work out why my daughter was getting nosebleeds, headaches and mood swings, and when I came across the vapes hidden in her bedroom I was shocked,\" she said.The girl told her mother she started vaping because all of her friends at school were doing it, and it got to the point where she was being picked on because she was not doing it.She has now stopped vaping and feels much better for it, the mother said.Vapes or e-cigarettes are far safer than normal cigarettes because they do not contain harmful tobacco, or produce dangerous tar or carbon monoxide from tobacco smoke.However, health experts say they are not risk-free, and more research is needed to find out about their potential effects over many years.They do contain nicotine - the substance which makes people addicted to smoking. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care in England said: \"We have introduced tough regulations to deter the appeal of vaping to children, including restrictions on product advertising, setting limits on nicotine strength, labelling and safety requirements, and making it illegal to sell nicotine vapes to those aged under 18 years old. \"We are carefully considering the recommendations from the Khan review: making smoking obsolete, including what more can be done to protect children from vaping.\"Dr Helen Stewart, officer for health improvement from the Royal College for Paediatrics and Child Health, said she was \"deeply disturbed\" by the rise of children and young people picking up e-cigarettes.\"We strongly advise children and young people against using illegal and unregulated e-cigarettes, and call on government and regulators to stop the sale of these products.\"She said plain packaging of e-cigarettes and nicotine and non-nicotine e-liquids should be introduced, as well as tighter restrictions on advertising of vaping products so they are only used as an aid to stopping smoking.\"If action is not taken soon, we run the risk of having generations of children addicted to nicotine,\" Dr Stewart said.","Description":"Shops selling illegal vapes and the sale of vaping products to children are the top threats on the UK's High Streets, according to Trading Standards officials.
